        maintains  a  list  of the top scores or scorers on
        your machine, depending on how it is set up.  In the latter case,
        each  account  on the machine can post only one non-winning score
        on this list.  If you score higher  than  someone  else  on  this
        list,  or better your previous score, you will be inserted in the
        proper place under your current name.  How many scores  are  kept
        can also be set up when NetHack is compiled.</p>

        <p>Your  score  is  chiefly  based upon how much experience you
        gained, how much loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and
        how the game ended.  If you quit the game, you escape with all of
        your gold intact.  If, however, you get killed in  the  Mazes  of
        Menace, the guild will only hear about 90% of your gold when your
        corpse is discovered (adventurers  have  been  known  to  collect
        finder's  fees).   So, consider whether you want to take one last
        hit at that monster and possibly live,  or  quit  and  stop  with
        whatever  you  have.  If you quit, you keep all your gold, but if
        you swing and live, you might find more.</p>

        <p>If you just want to see what the current  top  players/games
        list is, you can type vulture-nethack -s all on most versions.</p>
