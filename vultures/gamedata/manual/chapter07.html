    </div>
    
    <div id="main">

        you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want
        to pick it up. In Vulture's, this is accomplished automatically by
        clicking on yourself while you are standing on the object or
        by using the <span class="key">,</span> command.</p>

        <p>If you're carrying too many items, Vulture's will tell you so
        and you won't be able to pick up anything more. Otherwise, it
        will add the object(s) to your pack and tell you what you just
        picked up.</p>

        <p>As you add items to your inventory, you also add the weight
        of that object to your load. The amount that you can carry
        depends on your strength and your constitution. The stronger you
        are, the less the additional load will affect you. There comes a
        point, though, when the weight of all of that stuff you are
        carrying around with you through the dungeon will encumber you.
        Your reactions will get slower and you'll burn calories faster,
        requiring food more frequently to cope with it. Eventually,
        you'll be so overloaded that you'll either have to discard some
        of what you're carrying or collapse under its weight.</p>

        <p>Vulture's will tell you how badly you have loaded yourself.
        The symbols  &lsquo;<b>Burdened</b>&rsquo;,
        &lsquo;<b>Stressed</b>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<b>Strained</b>&rsquo;,
        &lsquo;<b>Overtaxed</b>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<b>Overloaded</b>&rsquo;
        are displayed in the status window to indicate your condition.</p>

        <p>When you pick up an object, it is assigned an inventory letter.
        Many commands that operate on objects must ask you to find
        out which object you want to use. When NetHack asks you to
        choose a particular object you are carrying, you are usually presented
        with a list of inventory letters to choose from (see
        <a href="chapter04.html">Commands</a>).</p>

        <p>Some objects, such as weapons, are easily differentiated.
        Others, like scrolls and potions, are given descriptions which
        vary according to type. During a game, any two objects with the
        same description are the same type. However, the descriptions
        will vary from game to game.</p>

        <p>When you use one of these objects, if its effect is obvious,
        NetHack will remember what it is for you. If its effect isn't
        extremely obvious, you will be asked what you want to call this
        type of object so you will recognize it later. You can also use
        the &ldquo;<b>#name</b>&rdquo; command for the same purpose at any time, to name
        all objects of a particular type or just an individual object.
        When you use &ldquo;<b>#name</b>&rdquo; on an object which has already been named,
        specifying a  space as the value will remove the prior name
        instead of assigning a new one.</p>


        <h2 id="buc">7.1. Curses and Blessings</h2>

        <p>Any object that you find may be cursed, even if the object
        is otherwise helpful. The most common effect of a curse is being
        stuck with (and to) the item. Cursed weapons weld themselves to
        your hand when wielded, so you cannot unwield them. Any cursed
        item you wear is not removable by ordinary means. In addition,
        cursed arms and armor usually, but not always, bear negative
        enchantments that make them less effective in combat. Other cursed
        objects may act poorly or detrimentally in other ways.</p>

        <p>Objects can also be blessed. Blessed items usually work
        better or more beneficially than normal uncursed items. For
        example, a blessed weapon will do more damage against demons.</p>

        <p>There are magical means of bestowing or removing curses upon
        objects, so even if you are stuck with one, you can still have
        the curse lifted and the item removed. Priests and Priestesses
        have an innate sensitivity to this property in any object, so
        they can more easily avoid cursed objects than other character
        roles.</p>

        <p>An item with unknown status will be reported in your inventory
        with no prefix. An item which you know the state of will be
        distinguished in your inventory by the presence of the word
        &ldquo;<b>cursed</b>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<b>uncursed</b>&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;<b>blessed</b>&rdquo; in the description of the
        item.</p>


        <h2 id="weapons">7.2. Weapons</h2>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/obj_sword.jpg" alt="Sword" />

        <p>Given a chance, most monsters in the Mazes of Menace will
        gratuitously try to kill you. You need weapons for self-defense
        (killing them first). Without a weapon, you do only 1-2 hit
        points of damage (plus bonuses, if any). Monk characters are an
        exception; they normally do much more damage with bare hands than
        they do with weapons.</p>

        <p>There are wielded weapons, like maces and swords, and thrown
        weapons, like arrows and spears. To hit monsters with a  weapon,
        you must wield it and attack them, or throw it at them. You can
        simply elect to throw a spear. To shoot an arrow, you should
        first wield a bow, then throw the arrow. Crossbows shoot crossbow
        bolts. Slings hurl rocks and (other) stones (like gems).</p>

        <p>Enchanted weapons have a &ldquo;plus&rdquo; (or &ldquo;to hit enhancement&rdquo;
        which can be either positive or negative) that adds to your
        chance to hit and the damage you do to a monster. The only way
        to determine a weapon's enchantment is to have it magically
        identified somehow. Most weapons are subject to some type of damage
        like rust. Such &ldquo;erosion&rdquo; damage can be repaired.</p>

        <p>The chance that an attack will successfully hit a monster,
        and the amount of damage such a hit will do, depends upon many
        factors. Among them are:  type of weapon, quality of weapon
        (enchantment and/or erosion), experience level, strength, dexterity,
        encumbrance, and <a href="#skill">proficiency</a>. The monster's armor
        class - a general defense rating, not necessarily due to
        wearing of armor - is a factor too; also, some monsters are
        particularly vulnerable to certain types of weapons.</p>

        <p>Many weapons can be wielded in one hand; some require both
        hands. When wielding a  two-handed weapon, you can not wear a
        shield, and vice versa. When wielding a one-handed weapon, you
        can have another weapon ready to use by setting things up with
        the <span class="key">x</span> command, which exchanges your primary (the one being
        wielded)  and alternate weapons. And if you have proficiency in
        the &ldquo;two weapon combat&rdquo; skill, you may wield both weapons
        simultaneously as primary and secondary; use the &lsquo;<b>#twoweapon</b>&rsquo;
        extended command to engage or disengage that. Only some types of
        characters  (barbarians, for instance) have the necessary skill
        available. Even with that skill, using two weapons at once
        incurs a penalty in the chance to hit your target compared to using
        just one weapon at a time.</p>

        <p>There might be times when you'd rather not wield any weapon
        at all. To accomplish that, wield &lsquo;-&rsquo;, or else use the
        <span class="key">A</span> command which allows you to unwield the
        current weapon in addition to taking off other worn items.</p>

        <p>Those of you in the audience who are AD&amp;D players, be aware
        that each weapon which existed in AD&amp;D does roughly the same
        damage to monsters in NetHack. Some of the more obscure weapons
        (such as the aklys, lucern hammer, and bec-de-corbin) are defined
        in an appendix to Unearthed Arcana, an AD&amp;D supplement.</p>

        <p>The commands to use weapons are</p>
        <ul class="cmdlist">
            <li><span class="key">w</span> (wield),</li>
            <li><span class="key">t</span> (throw),</li>
            <li><span class="key">f</span> (fire, an alternative way of throwing),</li>
            <li><span class="key">Q</span> (quiver),</li>
            <li><span class="key">x</span> (exchange),</li>
            <li>&lsquo;<b>#twoweapon</b>&rsquo;, and</li>
            <li>&lsquo;<b>#enhance</b>&rsquo;.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 id="shoot">7.2.1. Throwing and shooting</h3>

        <p>You can throw just about anything via the <span class="key">t</span> command. It
        will prompt for the item to throw; picking &lsquo;?&rsquo; will list things
        in your inventory which are considered likely to be thrown, or
        picking &lsquo;*&rsquo; will list your entire inventory. After you've chosen
        what to throw, you will be prompted for a direction rather than
        for a specific target. The distance something can be thrown depends
        mainly on the type of object and your strength. Arrows can
        be thrown by hand, but can be thrown much farther and will be
        more likely to hit when thrown while you are wielding a bow.</p>

        <p>You can simplify the throwing operation by using the <span class="key">Q</span>
        command to select your preferred &ldquo;missile&rdquo;, then using the  <span class="key">f</span>
        command to throw it. You'll be prompted for a direction as
        above, but you don't have to specify which item to throw each
        time you use <span class="key">f</span>. There is also an option, autoquiver, which has
        NetHack choose another item to automatically fill your quiver
        when the inventory slot used for <span class="key">Q</span> runs out.</p>

        <p>Some characters have the ability to fire a volley of multiple
        items in a single turn. Knowing how to load several rounds
        of ammunition at once &mdash; or hold several missiles in your hand  &mdash; 
        and still hit a target is not an easy task. Rangers are among
        those who are adept at this task, as are those with a high level
        of proficiency in the relevant weapon skill (in bow skill if
        you're wielding one to shoot arrows, in crossbow skill if you're
        wielding one to shoot bolts, or in sling skill if you're wielding
        one to shoot stones). The number of items that the character has
        a chance to fire varies from turn to turn. You can explicitly
        limit the number of shots by using a numeric prefix before the
        <span class="key">t</span> or <span class="key">f</span> command.
        For example, &ldquo;n2f&rdquo; would ensure that at most 2 arrows are shot even
        if you could have fired 3. If you specify a larger number than
        would have been shot (&ldquo;n4f&rdquo; in this example), you'll just end up
        shooting the same number (3, here) as if no limit had been specified.
        Once the volley is in motion, all of the items will travel
        in the same direction; if the first ones kill a monster, the others
        can still continue beyond that spot.</p>


        <h3 id="skill">7.2.2. Weapon proficiency</h3>

        <p>You will have varying degrees of skill in the weapons available.
        Weapon proficiency, or weapon skills, affect how well you
        can use particular types of weapons, and you'll be able to
        improve your skills as you progress through a  game, depending on
        your role, your experience level, and use of the weapons.</p>

        <p>For the purposes of proficiency, weapons have been divided
        up into various groups such as daggers, broadswords, and
        polearms. Each role has a limit on what level of proficiency a
        character can achieve for each group. For instance, wizards can
        become highly skilled in daggers or staves but not in swords or
        bows.</p>

        <p>The &lsquo;<b>#enhance</b>&rsquo; extended command is used to review current
        weapons proficiency (also spell proficiency) and to choose which
        skill(s) to improve when you've used one or more skills enough to
        become eligible to do so. The skill rankings are &ldquo;<b>none</b>&rdquo;
        (sometimes also referred to as &ldquo;<b>restricted</b>&rdquo;, because you won't be
        able to advance), &ldquo;<b>unskilled</b>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<b>basic</b>&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;<b>skilled</b>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<b>expert</b>&rdquo;. Restricted
        skills simply will not appear in the list
        shown by  &lsquo;<b>#enhance</b>&rsquo;. (Divine intervention might unrestrict a
        particular skill, in which case it will start at unskilled and be
        limited to basic.)  Some characters can enhance their barehanded
        combat or martial arts skill beyond expert to &ldquo;<b>master</b>&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;<b>grand master</b>&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>Use of a weapon in which you're restricted or unskilled will
        incur a modest penalty in the chance to hit a monster and also in
        the amount of damage done when you do hit; at basic level, there
        is no penalty or bonus; at skilled level, you receive a  modest
        bonus in the chance to hit and amount of damage done; at expert
        level, the bonus is higher. A successful hit has a  chance to
        boost your training towards the next skill level (unless you've
        already reached the limit for this skill). Once such training
        reaches the threshold for that next level, you'll be told that
        you feel more confident in your skills and a golden plus will be
        displayed above the top right corner of the status window. At that
        point you can click on the plus or use  &lsquo;<b>#enhance</b>&rsquo;
        to increase one or more skills. Such skills are
        not increased automatically because there is a limit to your
        total overall skills, so you need to actively choose which skills
        to enhance and which to ignore.</p>

        <h2 id="armor">7.3. Armor</h2>

        <p>Lots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to protect
        yourself from their blows. Some types of armor offer better
        protection than others. Your armor class is a  measure of this
        protection. Armor class (AC) is measured as in AD&amp;D, with 10
        being the equivalent of no armor, and lower numbers meaning better
        armor. Each suit of armor which exists in AD&amp;D gives the same
        protection in NetHack. Here is an (incomplete) list of the armor
        classes provided by various suits of armor:</p>
        
        <table style="margin:auto;">
            <tr><td>dragon scale mail</td><td>1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>plate mail</td><td>3</td></tr>
            <tr><td>crystal plate mail</td><td>3</td></tr>
            <tr><td>bronze plate mail</td><td>4</td></tr>
            <tr><td>splint mail</td><td>4</td></tr>
            <tr><td>banded mail</td><td>4</td></tr>
            <tr><td>dwarvish mithril-coat</td><td>4</td></tr>
            <tr><td>elven mithril-coat</td><td>5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>chain mail</td><td>5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>orcish chain mail</td><td>6</td></tr>
            <tr><td>scale mail</td><td>6</td></tr>
            <tr><td>studded leather armor</td><td>7</td></tr>
            <tr><td>ring mail</td><td>7</td></tr>
            <tr><td>orcish ring mail</td><td>8</td></tr>
            <tr><td>leather armor</td><td>8</td></tr>
            <tr><td>leather jacket</td><td>9</td></tr>
            <tr><td>no armor</td><td>10</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>You can also wear other pieces of armor (ex. helmets, boots,
        shields, cloaks) to lower your armor class even further, but you
        can only wear one item of each category (one suit of armor, one
        cloak, one helmet, one shield, and so on) at a time.</p>

        <p>If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection will
        be better  (or worse)  than normal, and its &ldquo;plus&rdquo; (or minus)
        will subtract from your armor class. For example, a  +1 chain
        mail would give you better protection than normal chain mail,
        lowering your armor class one unit further to 4. When you put on
        a piece of armor, you immediately find out the armor class and
        any &ldquo;plusses&rdquo; it provides. Cursed pieces of armor usually have
        negative enchantments (minuses) in addition to being unremovable.</p>

        <p>Many types of armor are subject to some kind of damage like
        rust. Such damage can be repaired. Some types of armor may
        inhibit spell casting.</p>

        <p>The commands to use armor are <span class="key">W</span> (wear)
        and <span class="key">T</span> (take off).
        The  <span class="key">A</span>  command can also be used to take off armor as well as
        other worn items.</p>


        <h2 id="food">7.4. Food</h2>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/obj_food.jpg" alt="Apple and pear" />
        <p>Food is necessary to survive. If you go too long without
        eating you will faint, and eventually die of starvation. Some
        types of food will spoil, and become unhealthy to eat, if not
        protected. Food stored in ice boxes or tins (&ldquo;cans&rdquo;)
        will usually stay fresh, but ice boxes are heavy, and tins take a while
        to open.</p>

        <p>When you kill monsters, they usually leave corpses which are
        also &ldquo;food.&rdquo; Many, but not all, of these are edible; some also
        give you special powers when you eat them. A good rule of thumb
        is &ldquo;you are what you eat.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Some character roles and some monsters are vegetarian. Vegetarian
        monsters will typically never eat animal corpses, while
        vegetarian players can, but with some rather unpleasant side-effects.</p>

        <p>You can name one food item after something you like to eat
        with the fruit option.</p>

        <p>The command to eat food is <span class="key">e</span>.</p>


        <h2 id="scrolls">7.5. Scrolls</h2>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/obj_scroll.jpg" alt="Scroll" />
        <p>Scrolls are labeled with various titles, probably chosen by
        ancient wizards for their amusement value (ex. &ldquo;READ ME,&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;THANX MAUD&rdquo; backwards). Scrolls disappear after you read them
        (except for blank ones, without magic spells on them).</p>

        <p>One of the most useful of these is the scroll of identify,
        which can be used to determine what another object is, whether it
        is cursed or blessed, and how many uses it has left. Some objects
        of subtle enchantment are difficult to identify without these.</p>

        <p>A mail daemon may run up and deliver mail to you as a scroll
        of mail (on versions compiled with this feature). To use this
        feature on versions where NetHack mail delivery is triggered by
        electronic mail appearing in your system mailbox, you must let
        NetHack know where to look for new mail by setting the &ldquo;MAIL&rdquo;
        environment variable to the file name of your mailbox. You may
        also want to set the &ldquo;MAILREADER&rdquo; environment variable to the
        file name of your favorite reader, so NetHack can shell to it
        when you read the scroll. On versions of NetHack where mail is
        randomly generated internal to the game, these environment
        variables are ignored. You can disable the mail daemon by turning
        off the mail option.</p>

        <p>The command to read a scroll is <span class="key">r</span>.</p>


        <h2 id="potions">7.6. Potions</h2>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/obj_potion.jpg" alt="Potion" />
        <p>Potions are magical liquids that usually have some sort of noticeable effect
        on you when drink them (Command: <span class="key">q</span> for quaff).  Each
        different type of potion appears as a flask of liquid of a certain color or
        description (i.e. a red potion or a smoky potion, etc.). Once you identify what
        a particular type of potion does (via an Identify spell/scroll or through usage
        or viewed effects), all other potions of that type will be the same (i.e. all swirly
        potions might turn out to be potions of levitation). Any further potions found that
        are of the same type will be referred to by their identified function (i.e. "a potion
        of extra-healing" as opposed to "an orange potion").  This scheme does NOT (for the
        most part) carry over from game to game; each new character you play will have the
        task of identifying their particular set of potions.</p>

        <p>You cannot taste a small amount of a potion in order to see what it will do, you
        have to quaff the whole thing. Be forewarned however - drinking unidentified potions
        could be helpful or harmful or just plain hilarious!  When you quaff a potion, you may
        get a message or obvious effect that will help you to identify it.  However, it is
        possible that you will get no indication at all as to a potion's effect or identity.</p>

        <p>Certain types of potions will lend themselves to uses other than drinking. You might
        throw (Command: <span class="key">t</span>) them at your enemies, for example...and
        achieve "various" results.  Another way to use a potion in combat might be to wield it
        (Command: <span class="key">w</span>) and engage your adversary in hand to hand combat.
        Even if you do not hit an enemy directly with a thrown or bashed potion, they may be
        affected by vapors which escape as the flask shatters to smithereens.</p>

        <p>Potions can also have object dipped (Command: <span class="key">alt</span>-<span
        class="key">d</span> or "#d") into them. Dipping an object does not always have an
        effect, but if it does, the effect on the object might be similar to that of a
        person drinking the same potion (but then again, it might not...interesting!). If
        dipping an object into a potion has an effect, the dipping action will consume the
        entire potion. Nearly any size object can be dipped (even very large objects such
        as plate mail - think of sprinkling the potion over a large object rather than
        actually dipping it into a tiny flask). If the object being dipped stacks in your
        inventory (i.e. 23 orcish daggers), the dipping effect will be seen on all of the
        stacked objects.</p>

        <p>There are also some potions that can be applied (Command: <span class="key">a</span>).
        Your character will have to reason out which ones, and to what effect.</p>

        <p>If a potion in your possession somehow becomes exposed to a large source of water for
        a short time, it may become "diluted".  Have no fear...a dilute potion still retains as
        much magic as a full strength one. BUT, if a dilute potion is exposed to large source of
        water for a short time (or a full strength potion for a long time), it may completely wash
        away.  If this occurs, what you will be left with will be a potion of....you guessed
        it...water!!  But hey, even a potion of water has got to be useful for something (or
        does it?).</p>

        <p>Finally, for those with a little bit of chemist in them, potions can be combined with
        other potions by dipping them into one another. When the two magical liquids mix, who
        knows what the results will be???</p>


        <h2 id="wands">7.7. Wands</h2>

        <p>Magic wands usually have multiple magical charges. Some
        wands are directional &mdash; you must give a direction in which to zap
        them. You can also zap them at yourself (just give a &lsquo;.&rsquo;
        or &lsquo;s&rsquo; for the direction). Be warned, however, for this is often unwise.
        Other wands are nondirectional &mdash; they don't require a direction.
        The number of charges in a wand is random and decreases by one
        whenever you use it.</p>

        <p>When the number of charges left in a wand becomes zero,
        attempts to use the wand will usually result in nothing happening.
        Occasionally, however, it may be possible to squeeze the last few
        mana points from an otherwise spent wand, destroying it in the
        process. A  wand may be recharged by using suitable magic, but
        doing so runs the risk of causing it to explode. The chance for
        such an explosion starts out very small and increases each time
        the wand is recharged.</p>

        <p>In a truly desperate situation, when your back is up against
        the wall, you might decide to go for broke and break your wand.
        This is not for the faint of heart. Doing so will almost
        certainly cause a catastrophic release of magical energies.</p>

        <p>When you have fully identified a particular wand, inventory
        display will include additional information in parentheses: the
        number of times it has been recharged followed by a colon and
        then by its current number of charges. A current charge count of
        -1 is a special case indicating that the wand has been cancelled.</p>

        <p>The command to use a wand is <span class="key">z</span> (zap). To break one, use
        the <span class="key">a</span> (apply) command.</p>


        <h2 id="rings">7.8. Rings</h2>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/obj_ring.jpg" alt="Ring" />
        <p>Rings are very useful items, since they are relatively
        permanent magic, unlike the usually fleeting effects of potions,
        scrolls, and wands.</p>

        <p>Putting on a  ring activates its magic. You can wear only
        two rings, one on each ring finger.</p>

        <p>Most rings also cause you to grow hungry more rapidly, the
        rate varying with the type of ring.</p>

        <p>The commands to use rings are <span class="key">P</span> (put on)
        and <span class="key">R</span> (remove).</p>


        <h2 id="spellbooks">7.9. Spellbooks</h2>

        <p>Spellbooks are tomes of mighty magic. When studied with the
        <span class="key">r</span> (read) command, they transfer to the reader the knowledge of
        a spell (and therefore eventually become unreadable)   &mdash; unless
        the attempt backfires. Reading a cursed spellbook or one with
        mystic runes beyond your ken can be harmful to your health!</p>

        <p>A spell (even when learned) can also backfire when you cast
        it. If you attempt to cast a spell well above your experience
        level, or if you have little skill with the appropriate spell
        type, or cast it at a time when your luck is particularly bad,
        you can end up wasting both the energy and the time required in
        casting.</p>

        <p>Casting a  spell calls forth magical energies and focuses
        them with your naked mind. Some of the magical energy released
        comes from within you, and casting several spells in a row may
        tire you. Casting of spells also requires practice. With practice,
        your skill in each category of spell casting will improve.
        Over time, however, your memory of each spell will dim, and you
        will need to relearn it.</p>

        <p>Some spells are directional &mdash; you must give a direction in
        which to cast them. You can also cast them at yourself  (just
        give a  &lsquo;.&rsquo;  or &lsquo;s&rsquo;
        for the direction). Be warned, however, for
        this is often unwise. Other spells are nondirectional &mdash; they
        don't require a direction.</p>

        <p>Just as weapons are divided into groups in which a character
        can become proficient (to varying degrees), spells are similarly
        grouped. Successfully casting a spell exercises the skill group;
        sufficient skill may increase the potency of the spell and reduce
        the risk of spell failure. Skill slots are shared with weapons
        skills.  (See also the section on &ldquo;<a href="#skill">Weapon proficiency</a>&rdquo;.)</p>

        <p>Casting a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing
        various types of armor may interfere with that.</p>

        <p>The command to read a spellbook is the same as for scrolls,
        <span class="key">r</span> (read). The <span class="key">+</span>
        command lists your current spells, their levels, categories, and
        chances for failure. The <span class="key">Z</span> (cast) command
        casts a spell.</p>


        <h2 id="tools">7.10. Tools</h2>

        <p>Tools are miscellaneous objects with various purposes. Some
        tools have a limited number of uses, akin to wand charges. For
        example, lamps burn out after a while. Other tools are containers,
        which objects can be placed into or taken out of.</p>

        <p>The command to use tools is <span class="key">a</span> (apply).</p>


        <h3>7.10.1. Containers</h3>

        <p>You may encounter bags, boxes, and chests in your travels.
        A tool of this sort can be opened with the  &lsquo;<b>#loot</b>&rsquo; extended
        command when you are standing on top of it (that is, on the same
        floor spot), or with the <span class="key">a</span> (apply) command when
        you are carrying it. However, chests are often locked, and are in any case
        unwieldy objects. You must set one down before unlocking it by
        using a key or lock-picking tool with the <span class="key">a</span> (apply) command, by
        kicking it (select <b>kick</b> from the context menu or use the
        <span class="key">ctrl</span>+<span class="key">D</span>
        command), or by using a weapon to force
        the lock with the &lsquo;<b>#force</b>&rsquo; extended command.</p>

        <p>Some chests are trapped, causing nasty things to happen when
        you unlock or open them. You can check for and try to deactivate
        traps with the &lsquo;<b>#untrap</b>&rsquo; extended command.</p>


        <h2 id="amulets">7.11. Amulets</h2>

        <p>Amulets are very similar to rings, and often more powerful.
        Like rings, amulets have various magical properties, some beneficial,
        some harmful, which are activated by putting them on.</p>

        <p>Only one amulet may be worn at a time, around your neck.</p>

        <p>The commands to use amulets are the same as for rings, <span class="key">P</span>
        (put on) and <span class="key">R</span> (remove).</p>


        <h2 id="gems">7.12. Gems</h2>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/obj_gem.jpg" alt="Gems" />
        <p>Some gems are valuable, and can be sold for a lot of gold.
        They are also a far more efficient way of carrying your riches.
        Valuable gems increase your score if you bring them with you when
        you exit.</p>

        <p>Other small rocks are also categorized as gems, but they are
        much less valuable. All rocks, however, can be used as projectile
        weapons  (if you have a sling). In the most desperate of
        cases, you can still throw them by hand.</p>


        <h2 id="rocks">7.13. Large rocks</h2>

        <p>Statues and boulders are not particularly useful, and are
        generally heavy. It is rumored that some statues are not what
        they seem.</p>

        <p>Very large humanoids (giants and their ilk) have been known
        to use boulders as weapons.</p>


        <h2 id="gold">7.14. Gold</h2>

        <p>Gold adds to your score, and you can buy things in shops
        with it. There are a number of monsters in the dungeon that may
        be influenced by the amount of gold you are carrying (shopkeepers
        aside).</p>
