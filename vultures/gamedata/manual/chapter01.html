    <div id="main">
        <p class="first"><img src="img/letter_r.png" alt="R" />ecently, you
          have begun to find yourself unfulfilled and distant
          in your daily occupation. Strange dreams of prospecting, stealing,
          crusading, and combat have haunted you in your sleep for many months,
          but you aren't sure of the reason. You  wonder whether you have in
          fact been having those dreams all your life, and somehow managed to
          forget about them until now.  Some  nights you awaken suddenly and
          cry out, terrified at the vivid recollection of the strange and
          powerful creatures that seem to be lurking behind every corner of
          the dungeon in your dream. Could these details haunting your dreams
          be real?</p>

          <p>As each night passes, you feel the desire to enter the
          mysterious caverns near the ruins grow stronger. Each morning,
          however, you quickly put the idea out of your head as you recall
          the tales of those who entered the caverns before you and did not
          return. Eventually you can resist the yearning to seek out the
          fantastic place in your dreams no longer. After all, when other 
          adventurers came back this way after spending time in the caverns,
          they usually seemed better off than when they passed through the
          first time.  And who was to say that all of those who did not return
          had not just kept going?</p>
          
          <img style="margin:auto;" src="img/valley.jpg" alt="valley picture" />

          <p>Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of
          Yendor by some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great
          wealth. One legend you were told even mentioned that the one who
          finds the amulet will be granted immortality by the gods. The
          amulet is rumored to be somewhere beyond the Valley of Gehennom,
          deep within the Mazes of Menace.</p>
          
          <p>Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is
          some profound and  undiscovered reason that you are to descend into
          the caverns and seek out that amulet of which they spoke. Even if
          the rumors of the amulet's powers are untrue, you decide that you
          should at least be able to sell the tales of your adventures to the
          local minstrels for a tidy sum, especially if you encounter any of
          the terrifying and magical creatures of your dreams along the way.
          You spend one last night fortifying yourself at the local inn, becoming
          more and more depressed as you watch the odds of your success being
          posted on the inn's walls getting lower and lower.</p>

          <p>In the morning you awake, collect your belongings, and set
          off for the dungeon. After several days of uneventful travel,
          you  see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of
          Menace. It is late at night, so you make camp at the entrance
          and spend the night sleeping under the open skies.  In the morning,
          you gather your gear, eat what may be your last meal outside,
          and enter the dungeon...</p>
