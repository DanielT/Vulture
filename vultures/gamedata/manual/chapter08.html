        Vulture's were not difficult enough, certain
        players seek to challenge themselves by imposing restrictions on
        the way they play the game. The game automatically tracks some
        of these challenges, which can be checked at any time with the
        <b>#conduct</b> command or at the end of the game. When you perform an
        action which breaks a  challenge, it will no longer be listed.
        This gives players extra &ldquo;bragging rights&rdquo; for winning the game
        with these challenges. Note that it is perfectly acceptable to
        win the game without resorting to these restrictions and that it
        is unusual for players to adhere to challenges the first time
        they win the game.</p>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/obj_food.jpg" alt="Apple and pear" />
        <p>Several of the challenges are related to eating behavior.
        The most difficult of these is the <b>foodless</b> challenge. Although
        creatures can survive long periods of time without food, there is
        a physiological need for water; thus there is no restriction on
        drinking beverages, even if they provide some minor food benefits.
        Calling upon your god for help with starvation does not
        violate any food challenges either.</p>

        <p>A strict <b>vegan</b> diet is one which avoids any food derived
        from animals. The primary source of nutrition is fruits and
        vegetables. The corpses and tins of blobs (`b'), jellies (`j'), and
        fungi (`F') are also considered to be vegetable matter. Certain
        human food is prepared without animal products; namely, lembas
        wafers, cram rations, food rations (gunyoki), K-rations, and
        C-rations. Metal or another normally indigestible material eaten
        while polymorphed into a creature that can digest it is also
        considered vegan food. Note however that eating such items still
        counts against foodless conduct.</p>

        <p><b>Vegetarians</b> do not eat animals; however, they are less
        selective about eating animal byproducts than vegans. In addition
        to the vegan items listed above, they may eat any kind of pudding
        (`P') other than the black puddings, eggs and food made from eggs
        (fortune cookies and pancakes), food made with milk (cream pies
        and candy bars), and lumps of royal jelly. Monks are expected to
        observe a vegetarian diet.</p>

        <p>Eating any kind of meat violates the vegetarian, vegan, and
        foodless conducts. This includes tripe rations, the corpses or
        tins of any monsters not mentioned above, and the various other
        chunks of meat found in the dungeon. Swallowing and digesting a
        monster while polymorphed is treated as if you ate the creature's
        corpse. Eating leather, dragon hide, or bone items while
        polymorphed into a creature that can digest it, or eating monster
        brains while polymorphed into a mind flayer, is considered eating
        an animal, although wax is only an animal byproduct.</p>

        <p>Regardless of conduct, there will be some items which are
        indigestible, and others which are hazardous to eat. Using a
        swallow-and-digest attack against a monster is equivalent to
        eating the monster's corpse. Please note that the term &ldquo;vegan&rdquo; is
        used here only in the context of diet. You are still free to
        choose not to use or wear items derived from animals (e.g.
        leather, dragon hide, bone, horns, coral), but the game will not
        keep track of this for you. Also note that &ldquo;milky&rdquo; potions may
        be a translucent white, but they do not contain milk, so they are
        compatible with a vegan diet. Slime molds or player-defined
        &ldquo;fruits&rdquo;, although they could be anything from &ldquo;cherries&rdquo; to
        &ldquo;pork chops&rdquo;, are also assumed to be vegan.</p>

        <p>An <b>atheist</b> is one who rejects religion. This means that you
        cannot <b>#pray</b>, <b>#offer</b> sacrifices to any god, <b>#turn</b> undead, or
        <b>#chat</b> with a priest. Particularly selective readers may argue
        that playing Monk or Priest characters should violate this
        conduct; that is a choice left to the player. Offering the Amulet
        of Yendor to your god is necessary to win the game and is not
        counted against this conduct. You are also not penalized for
        being spoken to by an angry god, priest(ess), or other religious
        figure; a true atheist would hear the words but attach no special
        meaning to them.</p>

        <p>Most players fight with a wielded weapon (or tool intended
        to be wielded as a weapon). Another challenge is to win the game
        <b>without using such a wielded weapon</b>. You are still permitted to
        throw, fire, and kick weapons; use a wand, spell, or other type
        of item; or fight with your hands and feet.</p>

        <p>In NetHack, a  <b>pacifist</b> refuses to cause the death of any
        other monster (i.e. if you would get experience for the death).
        This is a particularly difficult challenge, although it is still
        possible to gain experience by other means.</p>

        <p>An <b>illiterate</b> character cannot read or write. This includes
        reading a scroll, spellbook, fortune cookie message, or t-shirt;
        writing a scroll; or making an engraving of anything other than a
        single &ldquo;x&rdquo; (the traditional signature of an illiterate person).
        Reading an engraving, or any item that is absolutely necessary to
        win the game, is not counted against this conduct. The identity
        of scrolls and spellbooks (and knowledge of spells) in your
        starting inventory is assumed to be learned from your teachers
        prior to the start of the game and isn't counted.</p>

        <p>There are several other challenges tracked by the game. It
        is possible to eliminate one or more species of monsters by
        <b>genocide</b>; playing without this feature is considered a  challenge.
        When the game offers you an opportunity to genocide monsters, you
        may respond with the monster type &ldquo;none&rdquo; if you want to
        decline. You can change the form of an item into another item of
        the same type (&ldquo;polypiling&rdquo;) or the form of your own body into
        another creature (&ldquo;polyself&rdquo;) by wand, spell, or potion of
        polymorph; avoiding these effects are each considered challenges.
        Polymorphing monsters, including pets, does not break either of
        these challenges. Finally, you may sometimes receive wishes; a
        game without an attempt to wish for any items is a challenge, as
        is a game without wishing for an artifact (even if the artifact
        immediately disappears). When the game offers you an opportunity
        to make a wish for an item, you may choose &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; if you
        want to decline.</p>
