poisons; and with their instruments, they can divine
a being's state of health or sickness. Their medical practice earns
them quite reasonable amounts of money, with which they enter the dungeon.</td>

<p>You may also choose the race of your character:</p>
<p><b>Dwarves</b> are smaller than humans or elves, but are stocky and
solid individuals. Dwarves' most notable trait
is their great expertise in mining and metalwork. Dwarvish armor
is said to be second in quality not even to the mithril armor of
the Elves.</p>

<p><b>Elves</b> are agile, quick, and perceptive; very little of
what goes on will escape an Elf. The quality of Elven
craftsmanship often gives them an advantage in arms and armor.</p>

<p><b>Gnomes</b> are smaller than but generally similar to
dwarves. Gnomes are known to be expert miners,
and it is known that a secret underground mine complex built by this race
exists within the Mazes of Menace, filled with both riches and danger.</p>

<p><b>Humans</b> are by far the most common race of the surface world,
and are thus the norm by which other races are often
compared. Although they have no special abilities, they can succeed in
any role.</p>

<p><b>Orcs</b> are a cruel and barbaric race that hate every
living thing (including other orcs). Above all others, Orcs
hate Elves with a passion unequalled, and will go out of their way
to kill one at any opportunity. The armor and weapons
fashioned by the Orcs are typically of inferior quality.</p>
