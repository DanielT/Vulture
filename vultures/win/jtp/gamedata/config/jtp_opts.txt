% -------------------
% Screen Resolution
% -------------------
% 'screen_xsize' is the horizontal resolution and 'screen_ysize' is
% the vertical resolution. 800x600 is the minimum allowed resolution.
% Beyond that, you can choose any resolution that your display supports.
% In Linux, set 'fullscreen' to 1 to use a fullscreen mode. In DOS and
% Windows, the game always uses a fullscreen mode.
%
screen_xsize=800
screen_ysize=600
fullscreen=0


% -------------------------
% Music and Sound Effects
% -------------------------
% Turn these off (e.g. play_music=0) if you prefer silence, or if you
% don't have the appropriate sound hardware.
%
play_music=1
play_effects=1


% ------------
% Wall Style
% ------------
% NetHack - Vulture's Eye features several different display styles for
% walls. The available styles are:
%
%    full          Full-height, opaque walls. Looks best, but
%                  can block your view of objects next to walls.
%    half_height   Short, opaque walls. Less realistic, but
%                  allows a better view.
%    transparent   Full-height, transparent walls. Less realistic,
%                  but allows a better view.
%
wall_style=half_height


% ------------------------------------
% Recenter main view after movement?
% ------------------------------------
% If you enable this option (recenter_after_movement=1), the main
% window will follow your character's each movement. If you disable
% this option, the main window will only shift when you move off-screen.
%
recenter_after_movement=1


% ------------------------------
% One command per mouse click?
% ------------------------------
% If you enable this option (one_command_per_click=1), the game
% accepts only one command each time you click the mouse. If you
% disable this option, you can give several commands (movement,
% searching, etc.) by holding down the mouse button.
%
one_command_per_click=0


% ---------------------
% Game speed controls
% ---------------------
% How fast do you want the game to accept commands?
% You can set the minimum delay (in seconds) between two game
% commands here. For example, command_delay=0.1 means at most
% 10 commands per second. You can also set the minimum delay
% between two scrollings of the game windows (e.g. scroll_delay=0.1).
%
scroll_delay=0.1
command_delay=0.1


% ---------------------
% Gamma correction
% ---------------------
% If the game colours are too dark or too light, you can 
% adjust them here. Gamma correction values are decimal 
% numbers above zero. The value 1 gives the default game 
% palette. Values below 1 darken the palette and values 
% above 1 lighten it. Practical good values are from 0.5
% (very dark) to 2 (very light).
%
gamma_correction=1.0
