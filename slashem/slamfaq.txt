Q.      What is SLASH'EM
------------------------

At its very heart and core, it's still good ol' vanilla Nethack,
by the illustrious DevTeam (http://www.nethack.org/).

The code base from which this was started is SuperLotsaAddedStuffHack
(SLASH) 4.1.2E8, ported by Enrico Horn.  He took the old SLASH V6 (a
variant for Nethack 3.1.3) code by Tom Proudfoot, and ported it to use
the Nethack 3.2.2 code.  SLASH was probably the most popular variant
of Nethack.

On top of this is added the Wizard Patch 0.7 by Larry Stewart-Zerba
and Warwick Allison (also known for the Qt Nethack port).

Enriched with additional tiles by Dirk Schönberger.

Knead in Kevin Hugo's Balance Patch.

Add half a pound of bugfixes, new spells, tweaked/new special abilities
and features as they came to Warren Cheung.

Finally, factor in several years worth of development by the Slash'EM
dev-team.

Q.      What is SLASH?
----------------------

SLASH originally by Tom Proudfoot
SLASH 4.1.2E8 by Enrico Horn

SLASH is Super-Lotso-Added-Stuff-Hack.  Pretty much, it's Nethack with
more spells, monsters, artifacts, character classes and other added
features.  Originally by Tom Proudfoot.

See Ali's source archive for more details:

http://avrc.city.ac.uk/nethack/source.html

Q.      What is the Wizard Patch?
---------------------------------

Wizard Patch 1.0 by Larry Stewart-Zerba and Warwick Allison.

The Wizard Patch took the skills system in Nethack 3.2.2 and extended it
to include spellcasting abilities.  It also added some spells. As a note,
Warren chose not to include the decreased power regeneration code.

Q.      What are the new commands?
----------------------------------

Please consult the guidebook, a copy of which should be included
with all distributions.

Q.      Where did feature xxx come from?
----------------------------------------

Many of the changes from vanilla NetHack are the result of continuing
development and improvement of Slash'EM but many others date back to
earlier variants and patches.  Here is the original documentation of
the various bits that went into the original creation of Slash'EM.

From SLASHV6 
------------
(Quoted directly from a news post by Tom Proudfoot)
The changes from Nethack Plus, except for:
   * you _can_ wish for artifacts, except there is a chance it doesn't work
   * the hit point regeneration is completely changed, and is now
     based on your Con and Max Hp. A side affect of this is a ring/amulet
     of regeneration is not so easily identified, because it doubles your
     healing rate, and that may or may not be 1 point/turn.
   * the magic-weapon-to-hit-a-monster thing is still in there, but
     significantly toned down
   * the Doppelganger no longer prompts you "want to change (y/n)?" every
     couple of dozen turns. This drove me up the wall! If you want to
     polymorph, use alt-Y and 10 energy.
   * Warning is now actually useful, instead of annoying.

-shopkeepers have extra services
-class specials
-new character classes

About 150 new monsters. Some of the more, um, interesting ones:
   * rot worm -- Causes sickness, and is a low level monster. Fortunately,
     it's kinda slow. Unfortunately, it hides under things.
   * rhambusun -- Has a paralyzation gaze (lasts for only a couple of turns)
   * pyrolisk -- Has a fire-damage gaze
   * green slime -- Touch causes you to slowly turn into slime unless you
     burn it away.

The grand ol' list:
   a: snow ant, yellow jacket, tsetse fly, giant wasp, black wasp,
      army ant, spitting beetle, assassin bug, killer beetle
   b: jiggling blob, lava blob, crackling blob, burbling blob
   c: chickatrice, pyrolisk

      shadow wolf, mist wolf, death dog
   e: glowing eye, flaming sphere, shocking sphere, bloodshot eye,
      blinking eye, beholder, gas spore
   f: lynx, panther, werepanther, weretiger, sabre-toothed cat,
      displacer beast, hellcat, caterwaul, kamadan
   g: galltrit, jermlaine
   h: dwarf thief, duergar, master mind flayer, gnoll
   i: dretch, rutterkin, nupperibo, blood imp, larva
   j: red jelly, orange jelly, black jelly
   k: swamp kobold, rock kobold, kobold wizard, kobold warrior, Kroo
   l: leprechaun wizard, brownie, quickling, pixie
   n: Aphrodite
   o: orc, war orc, great orc, Grund, snow orc, demon orc
   p: glass piercer, roper
   q: scramper, squealer, mangler, mastodon, Jumbo, juggernaut, catoblepas
   r: rabbit, black rat, pack rat, rabid rabbit, hellrat, the Rat King
   s: centipede, recluse spider, barking spider, nickelpede,
      giant scorpion, Girtab, Shelob, werespider, carrion crawler,
      phase spider
   u: nightmare
   w: maggot, dung worm, acid worm, tunnel worm, rot worm, bloodworm
   x: arc bug, spark bug, lightning bug
   y: red light, blue light
   A: Solar
   B: rhumbat, athol, hellbat, mongbat, mobat, harpy
   D: shimmering dragon, silver dragon, wyvern, hydra
   F: disgusting mold, black mold
   G: gnome thief, deep gnome, gnome warrior, Ruggo
   H: storm giant, the Largest Giant
   I: sneaker, squeaker
   J: vorpal jabberwock
   L: arch-lich, Vecna
   M: troll mummy
   O: ogre mage, shadow ogre
   P: moldy pudding, green slime
   S: king cobra, weresnake, asphynx
   T: black troll, two-headed troll
   U: water hulk
   V: vampire mage
   W: wight
   Y: monkey
   Z: ghoul, ghast
   ': gargoyle
   @: mugger, thief, character classes (at all different levels),
      jackalwere, gibberling, grimlock, drow
    : shadow
   &: efreeti, dao, marid
   ;: shark, giant crab
   :: gila monster, salamander, rhaumbusun, basilisk, komodo dragon

There are new spells for the monsters to cast, and they will use a lot of the
new items, so be careful of the original monsters as well!

I tried to color the new monsters appropriately, and colored people
according to their clothing. There are some duplicated colors, now, though,
so be careful.

The characters are colored now, according to their preferred dress, so
the Tourist is purple, Elf green, Rogue black, Wizard blue, and so on.
Call me stupid, but this helps remind me which class I am, since I die
so often...

Pets only pick up 5 gold pieces out of a pile, and won't pick up a whole
bunch of arrows.

New terrain types: graves (you can 'r'ead the headstone, or dig it up)
                   toilets (um, you can sit, kick, drink, all sorts of stuff)

New artifacts, like the Eye/Hand of Vecna. I wouldn't use either one of
these too often, if I were you. There's also Mirrorbright the silver shield,
Whisperfeet the speed boots, and Deluder the displacement cloak. Also,
a bunch of weapons, which I don't remember too well.

Buncha special levels, like the Rat King level, the Kobold King level, Orc
level, Giant level, spider level, etc. Some are side-dungeons, others
aren't.

New rooms, like a Real Zoo (with zoo-like monsters), Leprechaun Throne Room,
Giant Throne Room, and stuff like that.

Buncha items. I remember these:

armor: silver dragon scale mail (reflection)
       shimmering dragon scale mail (displacement)
       gauntlets of swimming
       cloak of poisonousness (don't wear this)
       lab coat (poison res)
       asbestos jacket, fire helmet  (left over from my Fireman class)
       kicking boots

amulets: regeneration
         conflict
         polymorph

rings:   free action (no paralyzing! cool item!)
         gain Con/Dex/Wis/Int
         sleeping

potions: full healing
         invulnerability (for a few turns, anyway)
         polymorph
         clairvoyance
         ESP
         fire resistance

wands:   healing
         fear
         extra healing
         create horde (don't use this, unless you're studly)
         fireball (fortunately, monsters won't zap this one because I
                   couldn't get it to work right)

I feel like an idiot. There are certainly more items than these, but I can't
remember them. Oh well. Good luck, and try not to get killed by a horde
of snow orcs!

                           SECTION 1: CLASSES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A lot of the classes (new and old) have special abilites as of now, I'll
list as many as I can remember:

        "A" ->  Heheh ... when wielding you bullwhip try walking over a 
                trapdoor some time :)

                That fedora you are wearing .. there's something special
                about it ... see if you can find out (Hint: Watch your
                stats)

        "B" ->  This already is a very powerful class! However, you now
                get the ability to eat rotted corpses with no ill effect.
                (Note: You are NOT immune to sickness, you can just eat
                 ANYTHING!)

        "C" ->  Nothing too special, JUST infravision! (You'll know what
                I mean next time you play.

        "D" ->  Well, the ability to polymorph with out risk of level change
                or system shock is good enough, in addition you get the 
                ability to polymorph at will (costs 10 energy) at level 6.
                
        "E" ->  Pretty standard really, High Dexterity and Infravision.

        "F" ->  Ability to polymorph into a baby red dragon gained at level 7,
                at level 15 you can poly into a full red dragon. Baby dragon
                costs 25 mana, full costs 50. If you wear red dragon scale
                mail you can polymorph into a full red dragon at level 7 and
                above for a cost of 35 energy.
        
        "H" ->  Spell casting suffers if a shield or body armor is worn.

        "I" ->  See "F" except it's a white dragon.

        "K" ->  Can get Excalibur via dipping a long sword into a fountain.
                (All other lawful classes have a MUCH lower chanch)

        "L" ->  Hehe .. is EVIL! Can eat humans without penelty (actually, 
                it's GOOD to eat them :), ability to poly into a werewolf at 
                level 3. Is immune to other forms of Lycanropy and doesn't
                randomly change, you must use the CTRL-Y command (costs 10
                energy to transform into/out of werewolf form)

        "M" ->  Definatly has the most benifits (and hinderances :). You
                do 1d3 / 5 levels + 1 / level until 20 damage when not using
                any weapon (ie, you bare hands), -1 Ac per 2 levels and a 
                chanch of stuning or seriously maiming an opponent with
                bare hand attacks. Can hit monsters hit only by + level/4
                weapons. Hinderances, can not wear body armor or a shield 
                (well, you CAN but it's not recomended ... you bonuses are 
                severly diminished) may not eat ANYTHING he kills, if he uses
                any form of weapon, he suffers a -4 hit and -2 damage (and
                gets no bonus)

        "P" ->  What can I say? Their good enough as is :)

        "R" ->  MUCH better chanch of successfully Stealing gold form someone.
                It's a good idea to wear light (or no) armor while doing so.

        "S" ->  No change.
        
        "T" ->  Couldn't think of anything  ...

        "V" ->  Their good enough already!

        "W" ->  Best spellcasters in the game! See Healer armor restrictions
                on spell casting.
        
As you may have noticed if you have played the game, the usual stat maximums
of 18 have been altered for some classes allowing them to go as high as 21
in one case and as low as 7 in another. Here is a chart containing the
information for each class.
                           

 CLASS:  STR:   INT:  WIS:  DEX:  CON:  CHR:   NOTE: Some classes may have
  "A"    18     19    18    19    17    19           higher maximum averages   
  "B"    20     12    16    18    20    10           than others. This is
  "C"    20     14    16    18    20    15           done to reduce the power
  "D"    18/**  18    18    18    18    18           of really powerful 
  "E"    18/50  19    16    21    13    19           classes (Like Barbarian)
  "F"    15/50  19    17    19    16    18           and to increase weak 
  "H"    14     19    19    19    19    18           ones (Like Healer)
  "I"    18/50  19    17    19    16    18  
  "K"    19     17    19    13    18    19     Also, minimum for all classes
  "L"    20     20    18    18    20     7     are 3 for each stat.
  "M"    10     20    20    18    20    18  
  "P"    18/**  17    20    15    18    18  
  "R"    18/**  17    17    20    17    16  
  "S"    19     15    15    20    19    15  
  "T"    18/50  19    19    15    18    19  
  "V"    20     12    17    16    20    16

                           SECTION 3: SHOPS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Shops and Shopkeepers:

SPECIAL SERVICES:
All shops now have "Special Services" avaliable to the kind player who may
want to purchase them. I will only give a list of them so you know they are
there, I want to leave the actual discovery of them to you :)

For starters, to "activate" them simply try to pay for something when you 
owe nothing (in case you wondering, this is done so you just don't pick up 
everything in the shop and identify it BEFORE paying for it :)

        Services: (Varies with shop)

        Identify, Rustproofing/Enchant Weapons, Rustproofing/Enchant Armor,
        Charge Wand/Ring/Tool, Poison Weapons, Remove Curse, Apprase (This
        doesn't work very well)

PLEASE NOTE: I didn't write this code, but I can not find the name of person 
             who did anywhere in the source he gave me (It's been about 6
             months since I talked to him and I lost his address when my
             systems mail was purged). However, I have done MAJOR revisions 
             to it in my source to help balance this version, so please 
             refere all question and comments to me.

SHOPKEEPERS:
A brief note on shopkeepers, they are CONSIDERABLY more powerful now.  This
was done because of possable shopkeeper abuse due to the "Special Services"
they provide. You will now find it nearly impossable to kill these buggers,
they are now level 24 rather then level 10, have an 4 attacks per round, are 
very fast AND immune to sleep, poison and death rays (Ha!) If you can kill
one now, you TRULY deserve the abuse you can extract from them :)  This
power enhancement is also done to ensure fewer pets can kill shopkeeper by
themselves.

Sacrificing for artifacts:

This are has been changed to make it harder to obtain artifacts through
sacrifice. My reasoning for this is all the people who say "Aww ... 
Dragonbane! Thats junk! I'll throw that away and wait for something better"
or "Hmm ... Magicbane is good for a Wizard, but I'd rather have Mjollnir"

Now if you get an artifact, be happy! I mean, think about it ... to get 
something SO powerful from just sacrificing a newt on level 2 is crazy!
The gods don't have an infinite supply of artifacts to throw around, if
you are good enough to get one you deserve it but you HAVE to be GOOD enough
There's only one Mjollnir, only the mightiest will get it!

Ok, here's how it works:

        If you make a sacrifice and it qualifies to give you an artifact
        as it used to (ie. high luck, high align) you get 1 point.

        If that sacrifice just converted an altar, you get 5 points. The
        same applies to sacrificing a unicorn of an opposing color.

        You then have a chanch, based on the number of points you have 
        obtained and the number of artifacts in the game, of being granted
        an artifact. A number from 1 to 100 + 25 per artifact in existance,
        (ie. no artifacts -> 1 to 100, 1 artifact -> 26 - 125, etc) is 
        compared to your points. If your number is higher than the number
        picked, you get an artifact!

Now, this may seem like a good deal _BUT_ it has a few drawbacks.

        If you piss your god off, your points are reset to 0.
        (This of course includes changing alignments)

        Every 200 moves one point is deducted from your points. In other
        words, the gods like it when you constantly sacrifice ... not
        just a sacrifice now and then.

So there you have it!  Simple isn't it?  Mind you, this is about the only
way to get artifacts in the game at present. There are four others:

        (1) Find them. (Yes, it DOES happen :)
        (2) Become the Hand/Envoy/Soul Taker (or #dip for Excalibur)
        (3) Kill something that has one (like an Archon)
        (4) Wish for them (However, most generaly powerful ones have been
            disabled, such as Vorpal Blade, Stormbringer. But "minor" ones
            such as Dragonbane or Ogresmasher are still avaliable via wish)

                           SECTION 5: GENERAL
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

(1) Spells and Spellcasting:  I have totally overhalled the spellcasting 
    system, certain classes are better than others and use different stats 
    in determining sucess (ie. Wizard uses INT, Priest uses WIS). Instead of
    a flat success or fail, there is now a percent chanch of casting a spell 
    based on class, level, spell level and for some classes armor worn.

(2) Magical Creatures:  Certain creatures can only be hit by magic 
    weapons (or spells) of various power. Simallarly, some powerful creatures 
    strike as if they had magical weapons of various power. Ex: Unicorns are 
    now +2 or better to hit, and stike as if they had a +1 weapon. Another
    "common" monster hit only by +2 or better weapon is the Ghost

(3) Monster Improvements:  Powerfull monsters are now harded to kill, 
    including Shopkeepers. Some important monster may be immune to Wands of 
    Death (new monster intrinsic, no Mr. Barbarian you CAN'T get it by eating 
    him! :) ... players arn't the ONLY all-powerful force in THIS dungeon!

(4) Two New Commands:  There are two new commands avaliable in the game now,
    Steal (CRTL-B) and Polymorph (CTRL-Y). Anybody can attemp to steal, but
    the chanchs of a non-Rogue succeding is very low. Only four classes can 
    attempt to Polymorph: Doppelgangers (of course!), Flame Mages, Ice Mages
    and Lycanthropes (Duh!)

(5) XP and Levels:  There has been a drastic change in the ammount of 
    experence you need to gain a level, you now need a lot more. Many people
    have asked "Why so much? It's TOO hard!", the answer is simple: Power.
    There are two main reasons this was done: (A) To offset the powerful
    affects gain at the higher levels, like with Barbarians with a 20
    con ... they could have ~50 HP at level 4! So I made advancement slower
    to curb the rate of power increase, you will still have ~50 HP at level
    four, but it will take a long time to get there. (B) You will now 
    appriciate gaining a level, rather than "Oh, great. Level 7" it will
    be "YESSSS! I finally made Level 6 and it only took me three days, that 
    must be a new record!"  ... (Well, maybe not THAT bad :)

                           SECTION 6: SPECIAL NOTES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   The Patch fo the "Special Services" has been included in this version
   but has been drastically altared. If the author is out there reading
   this, please contact me.

   Also the Patch for the "Black Market" has been INCLUDED but not enabled
   in both the source and the executable. It turns out that it's a weee bit
   too buggy (Well, anything that has even ONE bug is too buggy. But thats
   another topic all together) to be used in my version. Again, if the 
   author is out there please contact me.

   There is (as far as my vast knowledge can see) only ONE bug contained
   within the source code. It have to do with dwarves with pick-axes not
   being restored properly, you will run into this problem. Just ignore it,
   the game will tell you the program is in disorder any perhapes you should
   quit but you don't need to as the problem is very minor and will have
   no effect on the outcome of the game. If anyone knows what might cause 
   this, PLEASE let me know

   
   DISCLAMER: I am NOT responsable for any damages this program may cause
              on you computer, socal life, job or sanity. It is mostly
              bug free and shouldn't have any major problems, however if
              you descover what you think may be a bug, please report it
              to me, Stephen White (swhite@cs.mun.ca).

         it somewhat, to be able to hold anything, multiplying by 4 the
         weight of everything in it if cursed, reducing by 1/8 the weight of
         everything in it if uncursed, and _negating_ the weight of
         everything put into it if blessed.

Additions from Kevin Hugo's Balance Patch
-----------------------------------------
New Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~
amulet of flying [tile from removed amulet]
  (instead of amulet of free action, which is a ring again)
  Worn: You can fly at will.
  Eaten: No effect.
  Coded and tested.

amulet of unchanging [tile from removed amulet]
  Worn or eaten:
    You won't change into the form of another creature, whether
    accidentally, intentionally, or periodically.  This includes
    polymorph traps and rays, the polymorph intrinsic, lycanthropy
    (were-creatures), turning to slime, becoming a "new man", or
    returning to your normal form.  If you were polymorphed, you
    stay polymorphed and will permanently die when you lose all
    hit points.  Lycanthropy may be purified, but you will remain in
    creature form.  However, you can turn into another material;
    namely, turning to stone, mimicing gold, or conversion/destruction
    as a golem.  It also does *not* stop the sliming process once it
    has started.
  Note: Magic resistance and/or polymorph control sometimes serve
    the same purpose.
  You have to be a metallivore (xorn would be best) to eat it.
    Then you would be stuck in that form, which probably isn't a
    good idea.
? Should the Doppleganager's quest artifact be this type of amulet?
  Fully coded but partially tested.

amulet versus stone [tile from removed amulet]
  Worn:
    You are resistant to turning to stone.
?   Each time you are stoned, the blessing changes from blessed ->
    uncursed -> cursed -> turns to dust.
    The stoning process stops if it has started.
  Eaten: Stops a stoning process which has already started.
  Coded and tested.

kiwifruit  [standin from asian pear]
  (Intended for starting inventory of new Zoutherner class)
  Same cost ($7), weight (2), and nutrition (50) as an apple.
  Random probability 3/1000.
  Coded and tested.

eucalyptus leaf [standin from sprig of wolfsbane]
  (Intended for starting inventory of new Zoutherner class)
  Cost $6, weight 1, nutrition 30, random probability 4.
  Cures food poisoning, sickness, and nausea.
  Koalas (a future creature) will only be able to eat this food.
  Coded and tested.  You can even wish for them in plural!

scroll of earth [standin from another scroll]
  (Derived from an idea by Virtanen <jajvirta@cc.helsinki.fi>)
  Blessed: Drops one rock on your head.
  Uncursed: Drops 2 to 6 rocks on your head.
  Cursed: Drops a boulder on your head.
  Confused: Drops the objects as above on the 8 surrounding squares
    instead of on you.
  Note: No effect on the Rogue level or in the endgame (except Plane
    of Earth).  The objects aren't dropped where the terrain won't permit
    it (e.g., no objects will be stuck in walls).  Amorphous, unsolid,
    and wall-passing monsters are undamaged.
  Cost $200, random probability 15/1000, marker charges 8.
  Coded and tested.

potion of acid [tile from removed potion]
  If acid-resistant,
    "This tastes sour."  (non-hallucinating)
    "This tastes tangy."  (hallucinating)
  Blessed: d4 damage and abuse constitution if not acid-resistant.
    "This burns a little!"
  Uncursed: d8 damage and abuse constitution if not acid-resistant.
    "This burns!"
  Cursed: 2d8 damage and abuse constitution if not acid-resistant.
    "This burns a lot!"
  Hits monster: Same damage as above.
  Vapors: Abuse constitution.
  Can be quaffed by players and monsters to stop the stoning process.
  Thrown by monsters as an attack.
  Cancels to water.
# Dip: Non-blessed removes erosionproofing.  Explodes with d10
    damage when dipped into any water or mixed with other potions.
  Cost $250, probability 20/1000.
  Coded and tested.

ring of sustain ability [tile from removed ring]
  Worn: Your statistics (Str, Con, Dex, ...) will neither increase
    nor decrease (e.g., by attack, poison, gain ability, or restore
    ability).  The adjustments are lost forever, and they don't appear
    after you remove the ring.  Does not affect changes due to worn
    items (e.g., ring of adornment, gauntlets of power).
  Eaten: No effect.  (Would be too powerful late in the game.)
  Sink message: "The water flow seems fixed."
  Notes: You can still accumulate exercise and abuse, although it
    won't result in changes in your attributes while the ring is
    worn.
#   You are not protected from other attack effects such as mind
    flayer amnesia or instant-kill poison.
  Cost $100.
  Fully coded but partially tested.

saddle (tool) [no tile]
  Can be found randomly and in pet stores.
  You can ride certain pets.  Try the following:
      Apply a saddle to various monsters.
      Kick or whip your steed.
      Try the above at various experience levels and monster tameness.
      Try getting on when polymorphed or impaired.
      Move around while riding.
      Try picking up or manipulating objects in the floor.
      Polymorph yourself (or your steed).
      Climb or descend stairs.
      Generate a bones file.
#     You are considered flying when you ride a flying monster.
      Dismount by applying the saddle.
  Partially coded and tested.  I don't think there are any game-
  stopping bugs, but there are several known inconsistencies:
      Your steed does not yet attack or get attacked.
?     Use your steed to carry things as a pack animal?
      Although I have attempted to compensate for the speed of the
        saddled pet, it is far from perfect.  To do an adequate job,
        I would have to completely rehaul NetHack's speed system.
      Traps, pools, and wounded legs are not properly handled.
      More inconsistencies as they are discovered.
  Conditionally coded by #ifdef YEOMAN, which is commented out be
  default.  You may experiment with it if you like, but the game
  should be distributed with it commented out for now.
  In the future, Knights and Yeomen will start with a pony, a saddle,
  10+ apples, and 10+ carrots.

fishing pole (weapon-tool in polearm category) [standin from pickax]
  (Idea by StarChaser)
  When you apply any polearm,
    You can't use apply a polearm if swallowed.
    You try to wield the polearm.  If you can't, no further effect.
    You are asked to select a square within a 3 square radius.
    You have to see the spot (hence no barriers permitted).
  There is a 1/6 chance of each of the following:
  1.  If using a fishing pole, you hook yourself with 10+d10 damage.
  2.  If using a fishing pole to attack a monster in water, you
      reel it in adjacent to you.
  3.  If you are using a fishing pole and there is an object on
      the floor of that spot, you snag the topmost object.
  4.  If using a fishing pole in water, you snag a low boot.
#     (Only occurs once per game.)
  5.  If using a fishing pole in water, you snag a cram ration.
  6.  Untraps (not yet implemented because the untrap code
      currently assumes you're on or adjacent to the trap).
  If the action selected above does not apply, but there is a
    monster on the square, it is attacked.
  Otherwise, nothing happens.
  Coded and tested.

healthstone [tile from removed stone of health]
  (Replaces stones of health and rotting)
  Each stone in your main inventory adds a bonus (+2 blessed, +1
  uncursed, -2 cursed) to the experience level and constitution used
  in determining your healing rate.  In no case will the effective
  experience level or constitution exceed their natural ranges.
  Regeneration is still a better effect.
  Same cost ($60), weight (10), and probability (10/1000) as a
  luckstone.
  Always generated cursed; a target for uncursed scrolls of remove
  curse.
  Coded and tested.


Deleted objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These following objects each convey a property that is obtainable in
another way.  This reduces the chance of getting a useful item in the
same item class, and none of these contribute _new_ ways to solve
situations.  They have been eliminated for the balance patch.
  amulet of conflict
  amulet of polymorph
  amulet of regeneration
  asbestos jacket
  fire helmet
  scroll of trap detection
  potion of fire resistance

I see little use for pan pipes.  Although some of them generate monsters
which could be helpful for sacrificing, the probability of other methods
(bags of tricks, wands of create monster) have been reduced.  In the
balance patch, pan pipes have been eliminated and the probability of the
other methods have been restored.
  pan pipe
  pan pipe of summoning
  pan pipe of the sewers

These new orbs make crystal balls more difficult to identify (they're
already not very useful), and I consider them a potential source of
charging/polypiling abuse.  Apparently they make up for the lower
probabilities and chance of success of their respective scrolls.  Why
not just keep the old scroll mechanism, which seemed to work well?
  orb of charging
  orb of destruction
  orb of enchantment

The following items now exist in a different form.  See above.
  cloak of drain resistance
  ring of drain resistance
  stone of health
  stone of rotting


Internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mixed case is now supported for the automatically-generated file
names (i.e., you can use "Slash-EM", "SLASH-EM", or "slash-em").
See patchlevel.h, makedefs.c, and file.h.

Added "skills.h" and moved code into it.  Zero is used to represent
no skill; positive numbers represents wielded items, launchers, and
spells; negative numbers are used for ammunition and projectiles.
Note that weapon_type() converts negative skill numbers into positive
ones, and spell_skilltype() never returns a negative skill.

Skills are now embedded in the object table, using the oc_subtyp
field.  The field size was increased to an schar.  This also makes
the order of items (esp. weapons) in the object table less critical.

Updated the following macros to reflect the above changes:
  is_sword()
  is_blade()
  is_weptool()
Added new macros:
  is_pole()
  is_spear()
  is_launcher()
  is_ammo()
  is_missile()
  is_multigen()
  is_poisonable()
  is_weptool()
  is_pick()
  ammo_and_launcher()
Incorporated these macros into the code as an alternative to the
WEP_ and WP_ constants.

Fixed some prototypes and invalid string constants.

Consolidated all worn and intrinsic bits to obj.h, and rewrote them
in hexadecimal for readability.  We have now exhausted all 32 bits.

Needed to move blkmar_guards() within shk.c so it will compile for
older 68k Macintoshes.

Repaired two bugs from NetHack.  If you carry nothing but gold, are
stressed, and fall into water, the game will no longer crash with a
divide-by-zero bug.  A line in uhitm.c, steal_it() had read
  mdef->misc_worn_check &= !otmp->owornmask;
and now reads
  mdef->misc_worn_check &= ~otmp->owornmask;

The Macintosh distribution is built with a fat binary.  This means
it will run on both 68k and PowerPC machines.


Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Entrance to Gnomish Mines moved to levels 2-4 (same as NetHack).

# You once again have 7 chances to start your quest, not one.

The Silver Wallet of Perseus now has an 85% chance of appearing in
either variation of Medusa's isle.  It used to only appear in one
of the variations.

Chance of generating a bones level increases with dungeon depth
(same as NetHack), not decreases.  No bones levels at depth 1 to 3.
You are once again asked if you want to create bones files in debug
mode (you couldn't make any at all, which made testing difficult).

If "your pack shakes violently" while stepping on a magic trap,
some of your inventory letters are jumbled.  Totally harmless to
the character, yet deliciously evil.
(Idea by Wolfgang von Hansen <wvh@geodesy.inka.de>)
# If fixed inventory letters are set, you instead get 2 hp damage
  for each item that would have been jumbled.

# The number of experience points needed for each level, and the
  level required to start the quest (*), has been adjusted again:

Hit-point healing algorithm now the same as NetHack's, with addition
of healthstones and a healing limit of 15:
  LEVEL  TURNS  HEAL RANGE   :  LEVEL  TURNS  HEAL RANGE
  ~~~~~  ~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~   :  ~~~~~  ~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~
  POLY    20         1       :   13      3      1 to 4

    9      4         1       :   22      3     1 to 13
   10      3         1       :   23      3     1 to 14
   11      3      1 to 2     :   24+     3     1 to 15
   12      3      1 to 3     :
Your healing rate depends upons your experience LEVEL, plus any
bonuses/penalties due to healthstones in your main inventory.
The POLY rate applies if you are polymorphed into another creature
or if your effective level is less than one.  You regain your hit
points once every given number of TURNS, or every turn if you have
regeneration.  However, you don't heal if you are stressed or worse,
don't have regeneration, and try to move that turn.  The amount of
healing is a random number between 1 and (effective constitution -
12); this value is adjusted so that it falls within the HEAL RANGE
for your effective level.  You won't heal beyond your maximum
number of hit points.

Many changes to the cost, probability, armor bonus, and marker
charges of many items.  Many have been restored to the values found
in vanilla NetHack.  Some points of interest:
  Polearms are about 1/3 as likely.
  Ammunition is more likely.  This works well with Warren's
    improvements to ammunition.
  Magical armor was very rare and gave no AC bonus.  Restored.
  Containers and unlocking tools are more common.
  Musical instruments are now very rare.
    (Note: Soldiers often carry bugles anyways.)
  Tin openers are less common.
  Scrolls (especially enchant ___) were too expensive.  Restored.
  Potions were too cheap.  Restored.
  The most useful spells are now the most common books.

Amulets are no longer randomly generated on the main dungeon floor,
although their probability in boxes and Gehennom are increased.
# Note that they will still be found in shops, boxes, chests,
  monster starting inventories, and preplaced locations -- just not
  on the floor before Gehennom.
Their effects generally do not overlap with other worn objects.
This means that some of the rarer intrinsics won't appear until
later in the game.

# Free action is once again (only) a ring, since it is most useful
  earlier in the game.  Eating it conveys only sleep resistance.

# You cannot get drain resistance by eating its amulet.

Polearms can be applied to attack within a 3-square radius.
Monsters do not yet take advantage of this feature.

You can no longer apply a bullwhip at an incubus/succubus to make
it your pet.  This variant code didn't allocate memory for the pet
information, which will eventually crash the program.  Since there
is no easy fix for this "feature", it was simply eliminated.

# A dwarvish mattock can be used to dig, by players and monsters.
  Shopkeepers also recognize them as picks.

Talking artifacts (e.g., Magic Mirror of Merlin) are finally
implemented.

Robes are the preferred dress of the clergy.  They are not generated
randomly, but priest(esse)s are found wearing them (they used to wear
cloaks instead).

Lab coat gives _both_ poison and acid resistance.
(Idea by Manzilla <manzilla@aol.com>)

# Note that yellow dragon armor still gives a better AC, but NOT acid
  resistance.  Yellow dragon corpses are still acidic, but do NOT grant
  acid resistance.  The player must make the critical decision between
  better AC or getting an intrinsic.

# The extremely unpopular effect of getting temporary intrinsics from
  corpses is discontinued; all effects are permanent.  Although several
  alternatives were proposed, this solution is least likely to lead
  to arguments or misunderstandings by players.

Eating a non-cursed, non-rustproof trident is "pure chewing
satisfaction" (idea from "Tommy the Terrorist") and exercises wisdom.
Eating a non-cursed flint stone is "Yabba-dabba delicious" and exercises
constitution.

# Scrolls of enchant armor/weapon have the same success rate as in
  vanilla NetHack.  To offset this, there will be a new disenchantment
  attack; it is not yet implemented and will only be used by monsters
  generated only in Gehennom (see below).

Engraving with a wand of enlightenment now zaps the wand, as expected.

Zapping yourself with wands of invisibility and speed monster behave
as in vanilla NetHack.  Invisibility is temporary if not yet invisible,
or permanent if you already are.  Speed monster is permanent, but note
that it does not convey "very fast".

Unlocking tools no longer break in locks when they are blessed or are
any artifact.

Dipping a tool in a potion of gain level upgrades it to another tool:

  tinning kit             tin opener
  crystal ball            magic marker

(Based on an idea by Dylan O'Donnell <dylanw@demon.net>)
# Note that gain level is now the only potion that causes these
  transformations, and the transformations work both ways.

Some classes (mostly BCVS) had significantly reduced chances of using
magic items such as scrolls, spellbooks, potions, and wands.  This
penalized the classes that newer players are likely to play (BVS).
Caveman (a moderately difficult class) is now the only class restricted
from using magic items, and all classes can quaff potions.  Of course,
players can still voluntarily place their own restrictions on their play.

Statistic maxima for all classes are now no less than 18 strength, 12
intelligence and wisdom, 18 dexterity and constitution, and 12 charisma.

New intrinsics include unchanging and fixed abilities.  Flying, stone
resistance, and acid resistance previously existed for some polymorph
forms and are now a full intrinsic.

Pets now pick up 10 times their level in gold, not just simply $5.

Tsetse flies changed from level 1 to level 3, so they appear later.

There are no new attacks or monsters.  However, some will be added in
the future Zoutherner class.

True rumors:
  A life saver is not the fresh maker.
  As Crom is my witness, I'll never go hungry again!
# The pen is mightier than the sword.
False rumor:
  They say that archeologists find more bones piles.
