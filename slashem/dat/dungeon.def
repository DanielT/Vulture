# Note:   The order of the definition of dungeons in this file
#         reflects in their order of creation in the real dungeon.
#         The "Main" branch must *always* be first.
#		Also note that the order of the dungeons in this file
#		determines the order in which branch levels are assigned.
#		If two dungeons have overlapping ranges for their entry
#		points, then you should list the dungeon with the _least_
#		number of choices for its branch level _first_.

### The Dungeons of Doom ###
# The main dungeon is from 42 to 47 levels deep...
# [Tom] stretched it out to make it a little more interesting, and
# have more "normal" levels, because the special ones were more
# frequent than normal ones!

# Early levels, to the Oracle
#   KMH -- The Gnomish Mines are an important source of essential
#   items for low-level characters: food, armor, and tools.  Even a
#   short stay in the mines pays off.  Slash moved the entrance
#   deeper, penalizing many characters.  The balance patch restores
#   the entrance to levels 2 to 4.

### Gehennom ###
#
# Now re-worked for 3.1, hell is hopefully going to be a little
# less boring.  Also, in 3.1, the tower is not considered as a
# part of hell, but is set up as a separate dungeon.
#
# Gehennom is no longer considered "hellish" as a complete dungeon.
# That is, fire resistance is no longer a condition for survival in
# it.  However, Gehennom, and the special levels in it in particular,
# is abundant with fire traps.  As a result, fire resistance is still
# a prudent survival strategy in Gehennom.
#
# Note:   Gehennom *must* be the second dungeon defined so that
#         monsters can properly migrate here under certain
#         circumstances.
#
# [Tom] tried to remove most of the non-unique levels (i.e. lame mazes)
# also tried to organize it a little -- demons before the wizard, devils
# after.
