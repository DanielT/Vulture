                          Version 3.3.0 - 1.3 Manual
        
        Legal stuff:
             AllegroHack (c) 2000 by Kelly Youngblood.
             AllegroHack is distributed under the same terms as 
               Nethack, see license for details.

        
        System requirements:
             Pentium class CPU or better.
             8 megabytes RAM.
             Windows 98, windows 95, or MSDOS-compatible operating 
                     system.

             AllegroHack may run on a 486 or with less RAM. It will 
        most certainly NOT run under Windows NT or Windows 2000.


        Installing AllegroHack:

             From the command line, copy ahack12b.zip to your Nethack 
        3.3.0 directory, and then type "pkunzip -d ahack12b.zip". Or 
        using Winzip, Extract ahack12b.zip to your Nethack 3.3.0 
        directory with the "use folder names" box checked.

             Then, edit alleg.cnf in a text editor such as Notepad to 
        set your preferences.  Edit defaults.nh and ensure the line 
        "OPTIONS=video:autodetect" doesn't have a # in front of it.

             Finally, run anethack.exe as you would nethack.exe.

             If AllegroHack crashes when you run it, make sure that 
        OPTIONS=video:autodetect is set in your nethack config file!
        
        Controls:

             F3 : Cycle HUD between equipment display, mini-map, and 
                  off.
             F4 : Toggle overview mode.
             F5 : Save screenshot. This will dump 2 files, 
                  "nethack.bmp" contains what's on your screen.
                  "nhmap.bmp" is a graphical map of the whole level.

             Control-Left  : Pan the screen left.
             Control-Right : Pan the screen right.
             Control-PgUp  : Pan the screen up.
             Control-PgDn  : Pan the screen down.
        
             (I can't get Control-up or Control-down to work)

        
        Known Bugs:

             There is a long pause when entering or leaving the rogue 
        level, just be patient.

             AllegroHack may not allow you to alt-tab out of it.  
        Create a shortcut to anethack.exe and make sure that all the 
        windows function keys are enabled in its shortcut properties. 
        You may also be able to shell out with '!' then alt-tab.
        If this doesn't fix it email me or post to 
        rec.games.roguelike.nethack.

             On some systems, AllegroHack crashes when the backspace 
        key is pressed.  I have no idea why.

        
        Contacting me:

             You can email me at jry@pinn.net, or post to 
        rec.games.roguelike.nethack.  I check news more often than 
        email, so a post to RGRN will probably reach me quicker.  In 
        either case, be sure to include "AllegroHack" somewhere in the 
        subject: line.
