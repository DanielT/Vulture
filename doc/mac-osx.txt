Thanks to eben for providing the following guide:

Here?s a rough guide as to how I compiled it:

This is done on 10.6.1

Install Xcode

Update to the latest Vulture?s source code

git clone git://github.com/clivecrous/vultures.git
cd vultures
git submodule init
git submodule update
install MacPorts ( Configure as per instructions on macports.org )

Install dependency libraries

sudo port install libsdl
sudo port install libpng
sudo port install libsdl_ttf
sudo port install libsdl_mixer
Build Vulture?s Eye

make nethack-home
Create a dmg

I?ve also tested this on a Mac that does not have MacPorts installed, there?s a problem with the linked libraries not functioning properly.

make nethack-dmg
