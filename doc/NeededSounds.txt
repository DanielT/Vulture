			* "Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.  Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
			* "%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!  You are a disgrace to the profession!"
			* "%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further taught you."

			* "Again, you stand before me, %p.  Surely you have prepared yourself."
			* "Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, %p.  You will never attain the glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has closed this future to you. "I will protect these people as best I can, but soon %n will overcome me and destroy all who once called you %s.  Now begone!"
			* "%p, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face defeat him."

			* "The world is in great need of your assistance, %p. About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known as %n, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands about him. "At about the same time, these people you once rode with 'liberated' a potent magical talisman, %o, from a Turanian caravan. "%nC and his Black Horde swept down upon %i and defeated the people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken subtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people. Then I sent forth a summons for you. "If %n can bend %o to his will, he will become almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of men across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you, and with %d behind you, you alone can defeat %n. "You must go to %i.  From there, you can track down then will the world be safe."

			* "I cannot stand against %ns sorcery.  But %d will help you."
			* "Do not fear %n.  I know you can defeat him."
			* "You have a great road to travel, %p, but only after you defeat %n."
			* "Well done, %p.  You have saved the world from certain doom.  What, now, should be done with %o? These people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as %n did. Take %o with you, %p.  It will guard you in your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a quest far greater than you realize. Remember me, %p, and return when you have triumphed.  I will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the time comes."
			* "You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search for the Amulet.  %Z await your return through the magic portal which brought you here."
			* "Tell us, %p, have you fared well on your great quest?"
			* "This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet of Yendor! "I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In the Book of Skelos, I found this:     %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to     be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.     It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor     that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time. "As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book speaks of you.     The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral     Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet     will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will     stand by %d as champion of all %cP for eternity. "This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."

I shall tell you what has transpired, and why we so desperately need your help: "A short time ago, the mountain centaurs to the east invaded and enslaved the plains centaurs in this area.

This will take some time, but if you can recover the Amulet of Yendor for %d before that happens, we will be eternally safe. "Take %o with you.  It will aid in your quest for the Amulet."
			* "With this wondrous bow, one need never run out of arrows. You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search for the Amulet.  %Z await your return through the magic portal that brought you here."
			* "Welcome, %p.  How have you fared on your quest for the Amulet of Yendor?"
			* "You have it!  You have recovered the Amulet of Yendor! Now attend to me, %p, and I will tell you what must be done: "The Amulet has within it magic, the capability to transport you to the Astral Plane, where the primary circle of %d resides. "To activate this magic, you must travel upwards as far as you can. When you reach the temple, sacrifice the Amulet to %d. "Thus will you fulfill your destiny."

Oracular major consults:

	* "If thy wand hath run out of charges, thou mayst zap it again and again; though
naught will happen at first, verily, thy persistence shall be rewarded, as
one last charge may yet be wrested from it!"
	* "Though the shopkeepers be wary, thieves have nevertheless stolen much by using
their digging wands to hasten exits through the pavement."
	* "If thou hast had trouble with rust on thine armor or weapons, thou shouldst
know that thou canst prevent this by, while in a confused state, reading the
magical parchments which normally are used to cause their enchantment.
Unguents of lubrication may provide similar protection, albeit of a
transitory nature."
	* "Behold the cockatrice, whose diminutive stature belies its hidden might.  The
cockatrice can petrify any ordinary being it contacts--save those wise
adventurers who eat a dead lizard or blob of acid when they feel themselves
slowly turning to stone."
	* "While some wayfarers rely on scrounging finished armour in the dungeon, the
resourceful know the mystical means by which mail may be fashioned out of
scales from a dragon's hide."
	* "It is customarily known among travelers that extra-healing draughts may clear
thy senses when thou art addled by delusory visions.  But never forget, the
lowly potion which makes one sick may be used for the same purpose."
	* "While the consumption of lizard flesh or water beloved of the gods may clear
the muddled head, the application of the horn of a creature of utmost purity
can alleviate many other afflictions as well."
	* "If thou wouldst travel quickly between distant locations, thou must be
able to control thy teleports, and in a confused state misread the scroll
which usually teleports thyself locally.  Daring adventurers have also
performed the same feat sans need for scrolls or potions by stepping into
a particular ambuscade."
	* "Almost all adventurers who come this way hope to pass the dread Medusa.  To
do this, the best advice is to keep thine eyes blindfolded and to cause the
creature to espy its own reflection in a mirror."
	* "And where it is written "ad aerarium", diligent searching will often reveal
the way to a trap which sends one to the Magic Memory Vault, where the riches
of Croesus are stored; however, escaping from the vault with its gold is much
harder than getting in."
	* "It is well known that wily shopkeepers raise their prices whene'er they
espy the garish apparel of the approaching tourist or the countenance of a
disfavored patron.  They favor the gentle of manner and the fair of face.
The boor may expect unprofitable transactions."
	* "The cliche of the kitchen sink swallowing any unfortunate rings that contact
its pernicious surface reflecteth greater truth than many homilies, yet
even so, few have developed the skill to identify enchanted rings by the
transfigurations effected upon the voracious device's frame."
	* "The meat of enchanted creatures ofttimes conveyeth magical properties
unto the consumer.  A fresh corpse of floating eye doth fetch a high
price among wizards for its utility in conferring Telepathy, by which
the sightless may locate surrounding minds."
	* "The detection of blessings and curses is in the domain of the gods.  They will
make this information available to mortals who request it at their places of
worship, or elsewhere for those mortals who devote themselves to the service
of the gods."
	* "At times, the gods may favor worthy supplicants with named blades whose
powers echo throughout legend.  Learned wayfarers can reproduce blades of
elven lineage, hated of the orcs, without the need for such intervention."
	* "There are many stories of a mighty amulet, the origins of which are said
to be ancient Yendor.  This amulet doth have awesome power, and the gods
desire it greatly.  Mortals mayst tap only portions of its terrible
abilities.  The stories tell of mortals seeing what their eyes cannot
see and seeking places of magical transportation, while having this
amulet in their possession.  Others say a mortal must wear the amulet to
obtain these powers.  But verily, such power comes at great cost, to
preserve the balance."
	* "It is said that thou mayst gain entry to Moloch's sanctuary, if thou
darest, from a place where the ground vibrateth in the deepest depths of
Gehennom.  Thou needs must have the aid of three magical items.  The
pure sound of a silver bell shall announce thee.  The terrible runes,
read from Moloch's book, shall cause the earth to tremble mightily.  The
light of an enchanted candelabrum shall show thee the way."
	* "In the deepest recesses of the Dungeons of Doom, guarding access to the
nether regions, there standeth a castle, wherein lieth a wand of wishes.
If thou wouldst gain entry, bear with thee an instrument of music, for the
pontlevis may be charmed down with the proper melody.  What notes comprise
it only the gods know, but a musical mastermind may yet succeed by witful
improvisation.  However, the less perspicacious are not without recourse,
should they be prepared to circumambulate the castle to the postern."
	* "The name of Elbereth may strike fear into the hearts of thine enemies, if
thou dost write it upon the ground at thy feet.  If thou maintainest the
utmost calm, thy safety will be aided greatly, but beware lest thy clumsy
feet scuff the inscription, cancelling its potence.

Important plot messages:

--------

    "After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
    against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
    Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
    the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
    and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
    Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time."

--------
    
"Lately, your dreams have grown troubled.  Images of ruins, strange
creatures and combat haunt your sleep. Could these visions mean something?

Beyond the Valley of Gehennom are ancient ruins, the entrance to the Mazes
of Menace.

Rumor says they're full of monsters and treasure. Some have returned rich.
Many have not returned.

And somewhere within, below the monsters, the dust and cobwebs, lies the
Amulet of Yendor.

(or so they say)

The Amulet would bring you great wealth, if you found it.

Even if you didn't, minstrels might pay for your tale. 

Compelled by your dreams, you choose to enter the Mazes.

After days of travel, you arrive near the entrance.

You spend the night sleeping under the sky. Your dreams are uneventful, free
of visions.

Finally, morning comes.

Your belongings packed, you descend the long, rubble-strewn stairway..."
