To build a deb deb package for vulture:
Apply debian.patch to the source tree by running 

	patch -Np1 -i dist/linux/debian/debian.patch

in the topmost directory. Then run

	dpkg-buildpackage

as root (or possibly "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot" if you don't want to be root)

This will generate 3 deb files: vulture-data_<ver>.deb, vulture-nethack_<ver>.deb
and vulture-slashem_<ver>.deb. The data package contains the tile images, sounds,
manual, etc and is over 20MB. The other two packages rely on the data package
rather than shipping all the data twice.
