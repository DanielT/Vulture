<center><h2>5. Rooms and corridors</h2></center>

<center><hr NOSHADE WIDTH="100%"></center>

<p><img SRC="letter_r.jpg" height=95 width=95 align=LEFT alt="R">ooms and corridors
in the dungeon are either <b>lit</b> or <b>dark</b>. Any 
lit areas within your line of sight will be displayed; dark areas
are only displayed if they are within one space of 
you. Walls and corridors remain on the map as you explore them.
<p>Secret corridors are hidden. You can find them with the <b>search</b>
command (left-click yourself, or choose it from the context menu, or press 's').
<br> 
<h3>
5.1. Doorways</h3>
<img SRC="dng_door.jpg" height=104 width=91 align=LEFT alt="Doorway">Doorways connect
rooms and corridors. Some doorways have no doors; you 
can walk right through. Others have doors in them, which may
be open, closed, or locked. To <b>open</b> a closed door, left-click it, use 
the context menu, or press 'o'; to <b>close</b> it again, use the context menu or press `c'.
<p>You can get through a locked door by using a tool to 
pick the lock with the `a' (apply) command, or by <b>kicking</b> it open (use the
context menu or press 'k').
<p>Open doors cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach
them straight on, horizontally or vertically. Doorways
without doors are not restricted in this fashion.
<p>Doors can be useful for shutting out monsters.  Most 
monsters cannot open doors, although a few don't need to (ex. ghosts can
walk through doors).
<p>Secret doors are hidden. You can find them with 
the <b>search</b> command. Once found they are in all
ways equivalent to normal doors.
<br> 
<h3>
5.2. Traps</h3>
There are traps throughout the dungeon to snare the unwary
delver.  For example, you may suddenly fall
into a pit and be stuck for a few turns trying to climb out. Traps
don't appear on your map until you see one triggered by moving onto it,
see something fall into it, or you discover it with the `s' (search) command. 
Monsters can fall prey to traps, too, which can be a very useful defensive
strategy. Left-clicking on a trap won't enter it; use <b>enter trap</b> from the
context menu to do this.
<p>There is a special pre-mapped branch of the dungeon based on the 
classic computer game ``<b>Sokoban</b>.'' The goal is to push
the boulders into the pits or holes. With careful foresight, 
it is possible to complete all of the levels according
to the traditional rules of Sokoban. Some allowances are permitted 
in case the player gets stuck; however, they will lower your luck.
To push a boulder, select <b>push</b> from the context menu.
<br> 
<h3>
5.3. Stairs</h3>
<img SRC="dng_strs.jpg" height=106 width=75 align=LEFT alt="Stairs">In general, each
level in the dungeon will have a staircase going up to the
previous level and another going down to the next level. There
are some exceptions though.  For instance, fairly early in the dungeon you 
will find a level with two down staircases, one continuing into the dungeon 
and the other branching into an area known as the <b>Gnomish Mines</b>. 
Those mines eventually hit a dead end, so after exploring them (if 
you choose to do so), you'll need to climb back up to the main dungeon.

<p>When you climb a set of stairs, or trigger a trap which
sends you to another level, the level you're leaving will be deactivated 
and stored in a file on disk. If you're moving to a previously visited level, 
it will be loaded from its file on disk and reactivated. If you're moving to 
a previously unexplored level, it will be created. Most random levels are
created from scratch, some special levels are made from a template, and
sometimes you'll find the remains of an earlier game (a ``bones'' level).
Monsters are only active on the current level; those on other levels 
are essentially placed into stasis.

<p>Ordinarily when you climb a set of stairs, you will arrive
on the corresponding staircase at your destination. 
However, pets (see <a href="main_6.html">Monsters</a>) and some other monsters will follow 
along if they're close enough when you travel up or down stairs,
and occasionally one of these creatures will displace 
you during the climb. When that occurs, the pet or other
monster will arrive on the staircase and you will end up nearby.
<br> 
<h3>
5.4. Ladders</h3>
Ladders serve the same purpose as staircases, and the 
two types of inter-level connections are nearly
indistinguishable during game play.
