% jtp_snds.txt
% This file contains event sound settings for NetHack - Vulture's Eye.
% Event sounds are sounds that are played when a particular message
% is sent to NetHack's message window. One message plays at most one
% sound (the first applicable one).
%
% The format is:   [search string],SOUNDTYPE,[filename]   where
%
%   [search string]
%      The message string, or part of a message string that triggers
%      the sound. For example, [crashing rock] plays a sound when
%      the message "You hear crashing rock!" is received.
%
%   SOUNDTYPE
%      This can be one of the following: WAVE, LWAV, MIDI, MP3, RSNG, or NONE.
%
%           - WAVE plays a 44100Hz 16bit mono RAW sound effect,
%           - LWAV plays a 22050Hz 8bit mono RAW sound effect,
%           - MIDI plays a standard MIDI file,
%           - MP3  plays a MP3 file (Linux only),
%           - CDAU plays a CD audio track.
%           - RSNG plays randomly chosen background music (see Section 2 below)
%           - NONE can be used to exclude messages
%             (eg. 'restore' is not the same as 'store').
%
%   [filename]
%      # XXX defunct (?)
%      This is the name of the sound file. Use short filenames
%      (of the form aaaaaaaa.bbb) to ensure compatibility with the DOS
%      version of Vulture's Eye. The format depends on the SOUNDTYPE
%      parameter, as follows:
%
%           - WAVE: the filename, including extension. For example,
%             [crash.raw]. The file must be in the "sounds" subdirectory.
%           - LWAV: the filename, including extension. For example,
%             [crash.raw]. The file must be in the "sounds" subdirectory.
%           - MIDI: the filename, including extension. For example,
%             [caves.mid]. The file must be in the "sounds" subdirectory.
%           - MP3: the filename, including extension. For example,
%             [nethack.mp3]. The file must be in the "sounds" subdirectory.
%           - CDAU: the track number. For example, to play
%             track 01, use [01].
%           - RSNG: not used, set the filename to [unused]
%           - NONE: not used, set the filename to [unused]
%
% Lines starting with % are comments. Blank lines are ignored.

% Section 2: special music and sound events
%
% These include music for the title and end title screens, 
% the introduction music, the in-game background music selection. 
% Sound effects associated with NetHack commands (like movement)
% are also defined here.

% that the search string is one of the special tokens given 
% below. The token nhfe_music_background can be repeated as 
% many times as required to add new background music.
