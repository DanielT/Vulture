Beyond the Valley of Gehennom are ancient ruins,
the entrance to the Mazes of Menace.
%valley.pcx
Rumor says they're full of monsters and treasure.
Some have returned rich. Many have not returned.

below the monsters, the dust and cobwebs,
lies the Amulet of Yendor.

%entrance.pcx
Compelled by your dreams,

%entrance.pcx
After days of travel, you arrive near the entrance.
%dawn.pcx
You spend the night sleeping under the sky.
Your dreams are uneventful, free of visions.
%dawn.pcx

%stairway.pcx
Your belongings packed,
you descend the long, rubble-strewn stairway...
