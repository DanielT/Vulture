    <div id="main">
        <p class="first"><img src="img/letter_v.png" alt="V" />ulture's
        has the ability to automate short sequences of keys.</p>
        
        <p>Since Vulture's - being an interface - knows nothing about the internal state of the game,
        thes makros differ only slightly from blindly typing out those sequences of keys yourself.
        In fact, the only difference is that Vulture's will aoutomatically acknowledge any dialogs
        that are encountered.</p>
        
        <p>The direct consequence of this is that all the &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; in the makro
        must be supplied by the user.</p>
        
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        
        <p>&ldquo;<b>n100.</b>&rdquo;: Rest 100 turns. A safe makro, because none of the keys it
        uses change over time or between games.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;<b>n20s</b>&rdquo;: Search 20 turns (or until something is found). Another safe makro.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;<b>n2f</b>&rdquo;: Fire twice (instead of the 3 or 4 times you might be capable of).
        An elegant and safe way of conserving ammo against weak opponents.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;<b>ey</b>&rdquo;: Vulture for NetHack asks "There is a &lt;foo&gt; corpse here,
        do you want to eat it?" if you press e while standing on a corpse. This makro would let
        you skip over that question. Whether skipping it is actually a good idea is an
        entirely different problem...</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;<b>ad</b>&rdquo;: Apply inventory item d (a pick axe or a key, for example).
        Very useful in multiple variants; for example you might want to have one makro to activate
        your magic whistle and another for your pick-axe.<br />
        This is till fairly safe: As long as &ldquo;fixinv&rdquo; is on, this will work. But beware:
        Inventory letters can <i>still</i> change. Assume that &lsquo;d&rsquo; is a pick-axe,
        which you drop to enter a shop where you buy a potion of oil. Later you use your makro
        again and find that you just set fire to your potion of oil... definitely annoying.
        Fortunately the <i>really</i> destructive actions ask for confirmation first.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;<b>Zb</b>&rdquo;: Cast spell &lsquo;b&rsquo;. This would usually be something
        like light, protection or similar. This is safe as long as you don't reorder your spells.
        If you do, you had better change your makro, too. Otherwise you might find yourself polymorphing
        a harmlesss creature into a dragon instead of killing it with a magic missile...</p>
        
        <p>This can be extended to zapping wands, and just about anything else you can think of.
        However you are advised to use common sense and caution.</p>
