        <p class="first"><img src="img/letter_d.png" alt="D" />ue to
        variations in personal tastes and conceptions of how
        the game should do things, there are options you can set to change
        how it behaves.</p>

        <p>This manual will not go into all the details of how NetHack/SLASH'EM
        options can be set; to learn about those, please read the orginal Guidebook.</p>


        <h2 id="options">9.1 Game options</h2>

        <p>There are 2 main ways to set game options: Ingame with the <span class="key">O</span>
        command and by editing the configuration file. Options set ingame do not persist; editing
        the config file is the only way to set an option permanently. Additionally, some options
        can only be set in the config file, because they no longer make sense or are immutable
        once the game has started.</p>

        <p>On unix(-like OSes) the config-file is called either &ldquo;.nethackrc&rdquo;
        for vulture-nethack or &ldquo;.slashemrc&rdquo; for vulture-slashem and is located in your home directory.<br />
        On Windows the file is always called &ldquo;defaults.nh&rdquo; and is located in the game's 
        installation directory</p>
        
        <p>These options are available:</p>
        
        <table style="border-spacing:5px;">
            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">align</td>
                <td>Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral, or
                align:chaotic). You may specify just the first letter. The
                default is to randomly pick an appropriate alignment. Cannot
                be set with the <span class="key">O</span> command.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">autodig</td>
                <td>Automatically dig if you are wielding a digging tool and moving

            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">autopickup</td>
                <td>Automatically pick up things onto which you move (default on).
                See pickup_types to refine the behavior.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">autoquiver</td>
                <td>This option controls what happens when you attempt the <span class="key">f</span>
                (fire) command with an empty quiver. When true, the computer
                will fill your quiver with some suitable weapon. Note that it
                will not take into account the blessed/cursed status, enchantment,
                damage, or quality of the weapon; you are free to manually
                fill your quiver with the <span class="key">Q</span> command instead. If no weapon
                is found or the option is false, the <span class="key">t</span> (throw)
                command is executed instead. (default false)</td>

                for &ldquo;role&rdquo;. See &ldquo;name&rdquo; for an alternate method of
                specifying your role. Normally only the first letter of the value is
                examined; the string &ldquo;random&rdquo; is an exception.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">checkpoint</td>
                <td>Save game state after each level change, for possible recovery
                after program crash (default on).</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">cmdassist</td>
                <td>Have the game provide some additional command assistance for

                <td>Have user confirm attacks on pets, shopkeepers, and other
                peaceable creatures (default on).</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">disclose</td>
                <td>Controls options for disclosing various information when the
                game ends (defaults to all possibilities being disclosed). The
                possibilities are:
                
                <ul style="list-style:none;">
                    <li>i - disclose your inventory.</li>
                    <li>a - disclose your attributes.</li>
                    <li>v - summarize monsters that have been vanquished.</li>
                    <li>g - list monster species that have been genocided.</li>
                    <li>c - display your conduct.</li>
                </ul>

                Each disclosure possibility can optionally be preceded by a
                prefix which let you refine how it behaves. Here are the valid
                prefixes:

                <ul style="list-style:none;">
                    <li>y - prompt you and default to yes on the prompt.</li>
                    <li>n - prompt you and default to no on the prompt.</li>
                    <li>+ - disclose it without prompting.</li>
                    <li>- - do not disclose it and do not prompt.</li>
                </ul>

                (ex. &ldquo;disclose:yi na +v -g -c&rdquo;) The example sets inventory to
                prompt and default to yes, attributes to prompt and default to
                no, vanquished to disclose without prompting, genocided to not
                disclose and not to prompt, conduct to not disclose and not to
                prompt. Note that the vanquished monsters list includes all
                monsters killed by traps and each other as well as by you.</td>

                something you find more appetizing than slime mold. Apples,
                oranges, pears, bananas, and melons already exist in NetHack,

                specify just the first letter. Although you can still denote
                your gender using the &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;female&rdquo; options, the
                &ldquo;gender&rdquo; option will take precedence. The default is to
                randomly pick an appropriate gender. Cannot be set with the <span class="key">O</span>

                Traditional was the only interface available for earlier versions;
                it consists of a prompt for object class characters, followed
                by an object-by-object prompt for all items matching the selected
                object class(es). Combination starts with a prompt for
                object class(es) of interest, but then displays a menu of
                matching objects rather than prompting one-by-one. Partial
                skips the object class filtering and immediately displays a
                menu of all objects. Full displays a menu of object classes
                rather than a character prompt, and then a menu of matching

        configuration file which overrides the global one as well as ingame.
        Additionally, if options are changed ingame they are written back to the
        per-user configuration file. The best way to change interface options is to
        simply use the dialog ingame.</p>

        <p>The file <b>vulture_sounds.conf</b> contains event sound options.
        You can add your own custom sound effects or music to NetHack events 
        by modifying this file. These sounds are played when a particular message
        is sent to NetHack's message window. One message plays at most one
        sound (the first applicable one in the file).</p>
        
        <p>Sounds can be OGG files or CD audio tracks.</p>
        
        <p>The format is: <b>[search string],SOUNDTYPE,[filename]</b> where</p>

        <ul>
            <li>[search string] = the message string (complete or partial) that triggers the sound.</li>
            <li>SOUNDTYPE = SND, MUS, CDAU, RSNG or NONE.
            <ul>
                <li>SND plays an OGG sound effect </li>
                <li>MUS plays an OGG music file</li>
                <li>CDAU plays a track from an audio CD</li>
                <li>RSNG plays a random piece of background music</li>
                <li>NONE can be used to exclude messages (eg. 'restore' is not the same as 'store')</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>[filename] = name of the sound file. If SOUNDTYPE is RSNG or NONE, then this value is not used.
            If SOUNDTYPE is CDAU, give the track number here (for example, [01]).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The file contains extensive comments and the existing entries are good patterns to follow.</p>
