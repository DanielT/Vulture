        you cannot see are not displayed on the screen.
        Beware!  You may suddenly come upon one in a  dark  place. Some
        magic items can help you locate them before they locate you
        (which some monsters can do very well).</p>

        <p>Hover the mouse over a monster to find out what it is called or select
        <b>What's this?</b> from the context menu or use the <b>Look at</b> command
        to obtain more information about it.</p>
        
        <p>The command <span class="key">C</span> allows you to assign a name to a
        monster, which  may  be  useful to help distinguish one from another when
        multiple monsters are present.  Assigning a name which is just a space will
        remove any prior name.</p>

        <p>The  extended command &ldquo;<b>#chat</b>&rdquo; can be used to interact with
        an adjacent monster. There is no actual dialog (in other  words,
        you  don't get to choose what you'll say), but chatting with some
        monsters such as a shopkeeper or the Oracle of Delphi can produce
        useful results.</p>

        <h2 id="fighting">6.1. Fighting</h2>

        <p>If  you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just attempt
        to walk into it.  Many monsters you  find  will  mind  their  own
        business unless you attack them.  Some of them are very dangerous
        when angered.  Remember:  discretion is the better part of valor.</p>

        <p>If  you  can't  see a monster (if it is invisible, or if you
        are blinded), a white questionmark will be shown when you learn of its
        presence. If you attempt to walk into it, you will try to fight
        it just like a monster that  you  can  see;  of  course,  if  the
        monster  has moved, you will attack empty air.  If you guess that
        the monster has moved and you don't wish to fight,  you  can  use
        the <span class="key">m</span> command to move without fighting;
        likewise, if you don't remember a monster but want to try fighting
        anyway, you  can  use the <span class="key">F</span> command.</p>


        <h2 id="pet">6.2. Your pet</h2>

        <p>You  start  the  game with a little dog, cat, or
        pony, which follows you about the dungeon and  fights  monsters
        with  you.   Like you, your pet needs food to survive. It usually
        feeds itself on fresh carrion and other meats.  If you're
        worried  about  it  or want to train it, you can feed it, too, by
        throwing it food.  A properly trained pet can be very useful
        under certain circumstances.</p>

        <p>Your  pet  also  gains experience from killing monsters, and
        can grow over time, gaining hit points  and  doing  more  damage.
        Initially,  your  pet  may  even be better at killing things than
        you, which makes pets useful for low-level characters.</p>

        <p>Your pet will follow you up and down  staircases  if  it  is
        next  to  you when you move.  Otherwise your pet will be stranded
        and may become wild.  Similarly, when you trigger  certain  types
        of  traps  which  alter  your location (for instance, a trap door
        which drops you to a lower dungeon level), any adjacent pet  will
        accompany you and any non-adjacent pet will be left behind.  Your
        pet may trigger such traps itself; you will not be carried  along
        with it even if adjacent at the time.</p>


        <h2 id="steeds">6.3. Steeds</h2>

        <p>Some  types of creatures in the dungeon can actually be ridden
        if you have the right equipment and skill.  Convincing a wild
        beast  to  let  you  saddle  it up is difficult to say the least.
        Many a dungeoneer has had to resort to magic and wizardry in
        order to forge the alliance.  Once you do have the beast under your
        control however, you can easily climb in and out  of  the  saddle
        with the &ldquo;<b>#ride</b>&rdquo; command.  Lead the beast around the dungeon when
        riding, in the same manner as you would move yourself.  It is the
        beast that you will see displayed on the map.</p>

        <p>Riding  skill is managed by the &ldquo;<b>#enhance</b>&rdquo; command.  See the
        section on Weapon proficiency for more information about that.</p>


        <h2 id="bones">6.4. Bones levels</h2>

        <p>You may encounter the shades and corpses of other  adventurers
        (or even former incarnations of yourself!) and their personal
        effects.  Ghosts are hard to  kill,  but  easy  to  avoid,  since
        they're  slow and do little damage.  You can plunder the deceased
        adventurer's possessions; however, they are likely to be  cursed.
        Beware of whatever killed the former player; it is probably still
        lurking around, gloating over its last victory.</p>
