            <tr>
                <td><img src="img/char_arc.jpg" alt="Archeologist" />
                    <b>Archeologists</b> understand dungeons pretty well; this enables them to
                    move quickly and sneak up on the local nasties. They
                    start equipped with the tools for a proper scientific expedition.</td>
                <td><img src="img/char_kni.jpg" alt="Barbarian" />
                    <b>Barbarians</b> are warriors out of the hinterland, hardened to battle.
                    They begin their quests with naught but uncommon strength, a trusty hauberk, and
                    a great two-handed sword.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><img src="img/char_kni.jpg" alt="Caveman" />
                    <b>Cavemen</b>  and  <b>Cavewomen</b> start with exceptional strength but,
                    unfortunately, with neolithic weapons.</td>
                <td><img src="img/char_pri.jpg" alt="Healer" />
                    <b>Healers</b> are wise in medicine and apothecary.  They know  the
                    herbs  and  simples  that  can restore vitality, ease pain, anesthetize,
                    and neutralize poisons; and with their instruments, they
                    can  divine a being's state of health or sickness.  Their medical
                    practice earns them quite reasonable amounts of money, with which
                    they enter the dungeon.</td>

                    <b>Knights</b> are distinguished  from  the common skirmisher by
                    their devotion to the ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing
                    excellence of their armor.</td>
                <td><img src="img/char_wiz.jpg" alt="Monk" />
                    <b>Monks</b> are ascetics, who by rigorous practice of physical and
                    mental disciplines have become capable of fighting as effectively
                    without  weapons  as with.  They wear no armor but make up for it
                    with increased mobility.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><img src="img/char_pri.jpg" alt="Priest" />
                    <b>Priests</b> and <b>Priestesses</b> are clerics militant, crusaders 
                    advancing the cause of righteousness with arms, armor, and arts
                    thaumaturgic. Their ability to commune with deities via prayer
                    occasionally extricates them from peril, but can also put them in
                    it.</td>
                <td><img src="img/char_ran.jpg" alt="Ranger" />
                    <b>Rangers</b> are most at home in the woods, and some say slightly
                    out of place in a dungeon. They are, however, experts in archery
                    as well as tracking and stealthy movement.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><img src="img/char_rog.jpg" alt="Rogue" />
                    <b>Rogues</b> are agile and stealthy  thieves, with knowledge of
                    locks, traps, and poisons. Their advantage lies in surprise,
                    which they employ to great advantage.</td>
                <td><img src="img/char_sam.jpg" alt="Samurai" />
                    <b>Samurai</b> are the elite warriors of feudal Nippon. They are
                    lightly armored and quick, and wear the dai-sho, two swords of
                    the deadliest keenness.</td>

                    with),  a  credit card, lots of food, some maps, and an expensive
                    camera.  Most monsters don't like being photographed.</td>
                <td><img src="img/char_val.jpg" alt="Valkyrie" />
                    <b>Valkyries</b> are hardy warrior women. Their upbringing in the
                    harsh Northlands makes them strong, inures them to extremes of
                    cold, and instills in them stealth and cunning.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><img src="img/char_wiz.jpg" alt="Wizard" />
                    Wizards start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection  of
                    magical  items,  and a particular affinity for dweomercraft. 
                    Although seemingly weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an
                    experienced Wizard is a deadly foe.</td>

                    <b>Flame Mages</b> have managed to harness mystical  energies  into
                    the  control  of  the element of fire.  Notwithstanding their pet
                    hell hounds,  woe be unto anyone who  stands  in  the  way  of  a
                    skilled mage casting a fireball.</td>
                <td><img src="img/char_ice.jpg" alt="Ice Mage" />
                    <b>Ice Mages</b> command the forces of cold.  An  experienced  Mage

                    <b>Necromancers</b> have delved into the darkest of the magical
                    lore, and mastered some of the most forbidden of the magical
                    lore. Many have fallen to the armies of the undead that they are
                    capable of bringing forth and controlling.</td>

                    <b>Undead Slayers</b> are specialists, trained to hunt the undead
                    as well as other incarnations of evil. They are well aware of
                    the weaknesses of their foes and come prepared. Few denizens of
                    darkness ever encounter such warriors of light and live to tell
                    of it.</td>

                    to stand doing nothing for hours. It is said that this is because
                    they are none too bright. Yeomen can both take a lot of damage

        <h2 id="races">2.2 Races</h2>

        <p class="first">You may also choose the race of your character:</p>
        
        <ul class="racelist">
            <li><b>Dwarves</b> are smaller than humans or elves, but are stocky and
            solid individuals.  Dwarves' most notable trait  is  their  great
            expertise  in mining and metalwork.  Dwarvish armor is said to be
            second in quality not even to the mithril armor of the Elves.</li>

            <li><b>Elves</b> are agile, quick, and perceptive; very little of  what
            goes  on  will escape an Elf.  The quality of Elven craftsmanship
            often gives them an advantage in arms and armor.</li>

            <li><b>Gnomes</b> are smaller than but generally  similar  to  dwarves.
            Gnomes  are known to be expert miners, and it is known that a secret
            underground mine complex built by this  race  exists  within
            the Mazes of Menace, filled with both riches and danger.</li>

            <li><b>Humans</b> are by far the most common race of the surface world,
            and are thus the norm by which other races  are  often  compared.
            Although  they have no special abilities, they can succeed in any
            role.</li>

            <li><b>Orcs</b> are a cruel and barbaric race that  hate  every  living
            thing  (including other orcs).  Above all others, Orcs hate Elves
            with a passion unequalled, and will go out of their way  to  kill
            one  at  any opportunity.  The armor and weapons fashioned by the
            Orcs are typically of inferior quality.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="first">Vulturesclaw has a few extra races:</p>
        <ul class="racelist">
            <li><b>Doppelgangers</b> have the enviable ability to change form at
            will, at a cost of some mystic energy (mana), although what
            they become may be a bit of a surprise, even for them.</li>

            <li><b>Hobbits</b> are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they
            are  inclined  to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are
            nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. A love of learning
            (other than genealogical lore) is far from general among
            them. Hobbits are difficult to daunt, or to kill, and at need can
            still handle arms.</li>
            
            <li><b>Lycanthropes</b> are wild beasts who draw  their strength from
            the  phases of the moon,  and can transform into wolves when they
            channel their magical energies.  Even unarmed, a Lycanthrope is
            a  savage fighter, as many scarred by their deadly claws can attest.</li>
            
            <li><b>Vampires</b> strike fear into the heart of many. Their super-human
            strength, notorious dexterity and resiliance make them difficult
            to defeat while their almost hypnotic charm makes them dangerous
            opponents. Even their own Gods treat vampires with some distaste.</li>
        </ul>
