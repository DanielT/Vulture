        <h1>5. Rooms and corridors</h1>
    </div>
    
    <div id="main">
        <p class="first"><img src="img/letter_r.png" alt="R" />ooms and corridors
        in the dungeon are either <b>lit</b> or <b>dark</b>. Any 
        lit areas within your line of sight will be displayed; dark areas
        are only displayed if they are within one space of 
        you. Walls and corridors remain on the map as you explore them.<br />
        Secret corridors are hidden. You can find them with the <b>search</b>
        command (choose it from the context menu, or press <span class="key">s</span>).</p>
        
        <h2 id="doors">5.1. Doorways</h2>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/door.jpg" alt="Doorway" />

        <p>Doorways connect rooms and corridors. Some doorways have no doors; you 
        can walk right through. Others have doors in them, which may
        be open, closed, or locked. To <b>open</b> a closed door, left-click it, use 
        the context menu, or press <span class="key">o</span>; to <b>close</b> it again, use the
        context menu or press <span class="key">c</span>.</p>

        <p>You can get through a locked door by using a tool to 
        pick the lock with the <span class="key">a</span> (apply) command, or by <b>kicking</b> it open (use the
        context menu or press <span class="key">k</span>).</p>

        <p>Open doors cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach
        them straight on, horizontally or vertically. Doorways
        without doors are not restricted in this fashion.</p>

        <p>Doors can be useful for shutting out monsters.  Most 
        monsters cannot open doors, although a few don't need to (ex. ghosts can
        walk through doors).</p>

        <p>Secret doors are hidden. You can find them with 
        the <b>search</b> command. Once found they are in all
        ways equivalent to normal doors.</p>


        <h2 id="traps">5.2. Traps</h2>

        <p>There are traps throughout the dungeon to snare the unwary
        delver.  For example, you may suddenly fall
        into a pit and be stuck for a few turns trying to climb out. Traps
        don't appear on your map until you see one triggered by moving onto it,
        see something fall into it, or you discover it with the <span class="key">s</span> (search) command. 
        Monsters can fall prey to traps, too, which can be a very useful defensive
        strategy.</p>

        <p>There is a special pre-mapped branch of the dungeon based on the 
        classic computer game &ldquo;<b>Sokoban</b>.&rdquo; The goal is to push
        the boulders into the pits or holes. With careful foresight, 
        it is possible to complete all of the levels according
        to the traditional rules of Sokoban. Some allowances are permitted 
        in case the player gets stuck; however, they will lower your luck.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="stairs">5.3. Stairs and ladders</h2>
        
        <img style="float:left;" src="img/stairs.jpg" alt="Stairs" />
        
        <p>In general, each level in the dungeon will have a staircase going up to the
        previous level and another going down to the next level. There
        are some exceptions though.  For instance, fairly early in the dungeon you 
        will find a level with two down staircases, one continuing into the dungeon 
        and the other branching into an area known as the <b>Gnomish Mines</b>. 
        Those mines eventually hit a dead end, so after exploring them (if 
        you choose to do so), you'll need to climb back up to the main dungeon.</p>
        
        <p>When you climb a set of stairs, or trigger a trap which
        sends you to another level, the level you're leaving will be deactivated 
        and stored in a file on disk. If you're moving to a previously visited level, 
        it will be loaded from its file on disk and reactivated. If you're moving to 
        a previously unexplored level, it will be created. Most random levels are
        created from scratch, some special levels are made from a template, and
        sometimes you'll find the remains of an earlier game (a &ldquo;bones&rdquo; level).
        Monsters are only active on the current level; those on other levels 
        are essentially placed into stasis.</p>
        
        <p>Ordinarily when you climb a set of stairs, you will arrive
        on the corresponding staircase at your destination. 
        However, pets (see <a href="chapter06.html">Monsters</a>) and some other monsters will follow 
        along if they're close enough when you travel up or down stairs,
        and occasionally one of these creatures will displace 
        you during the climb. When that occurs, the pet or other
        monster will arrive on the staircase and you will end up nearby.</p>
        
        <p>Ladders serve the same purpose as staircases,  and  the  two
        types  of  inter-level  connections  are nearly indistinguishable
        during game play.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="shops">5.4. Shops and shopping</h2>
        
        <p>Occasionally you will run across a room  with a shopkeeper
        near the door and many items lying on the floor. You can buy
        items by picking them up and then using the <span class="key">p</span> command. You can
        inquire  about the price of an item prior to picking it up by using
        the &ldquo;<b>#chat</b>&rdquo; command while standing on it. Using an item
        prior to paying for it will incur a charge, and the shopkeeper
        won't allow you to leave the shop until you have paid any debt
        you owe.</p>

        <p>You  can  sell items to a shopkeeper by dropping them to the
        floor while inside a shop.  You will either be offered an  amount
        of  gold  and  asked whether you're willing to sell, or you'll be
        told that the shopkeeper isn't interested (generally,  your  item
        needs  to  be  compatible with the type of merchandise carried by
        the shop).</p>

        <p>If you drop something in a shop by accident, the  shopkeeper
        will  usually  claim ownership without offering any compensation.
        You'll have to buy it back if you want to reclaim it.</p>

        <p>Shopkeepers sometimes run out of money.  When that  happens,
        you'll  be  offered  credit  instead of gold when you try to sell
        something.  Credit can be used to pay for purchases,  but  it  is
        only  good  in  the shop where it was obtained; other shopkeepers
        won't honor it. (If you happen to find a "credit card" in the
        dungeon, don't bother trying to use it in shops; shopkeepers will
        not accept it.)</p>
        
        <p>The <span class="key">$</span> command, which reports the amount of gold you are
        carrying (in inventory, not inside bags or boxes), will also show
        current shop debt or credit, if any.  The &lsquo;Iu&rsquo; command lists
        unpaid  items  (those  which  still  belong to the shop) if you are
        carrying any.  The &lsquo;Ix&rsquo; command shows an  inventory-like  display
        of  any  unpaid  items  which have been used up, along with other
        shop fees, if any.</p>
        
        <p>Several aspects of shop behavior might be unexpected.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The price of a given item can vary due to a variety of factors.</li>

            <li>A  shopkeeper treats the spot immediately inside the door as if
            it were outside the shop.</li>

            <li>While the shopkeeper watches you like a hawk, he will generally
            ignore any other customers.</li>

            <li>If  a  shop  is "closed for inventory", it will not open of its
            own accord.</li>

            <li>Shops do not get restocked with new items, regardless of
            inventory depletion.</li>
        </ul>
