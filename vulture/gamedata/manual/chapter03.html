        <h1>3. The Interface</h1>
    </div>
    
    <div id="main">
        <p class="first"><img src="img/letter_o.png" alt="O" />n the screen is a view of a section of the current
        dungeon level; as you explore more of the level, it appears on the
        screen in front of you. A new dungeon is generated every time you play; even
        the authors still find it an entertaining and exciting game
        despite having won several times.</p>
        
        <p>In the corners of the screen you will also see your current status,
        2 toolbars that allow access to important commands and the minimap which
        keeps you from getting lost. You can disable the minimap and the toolbars
        if you want to.</p>
        
        <img style="margin:auto" src="img/gamewin1.png" alt="The game window" />
        
        <p>Traditionally NetHack and SLASH'EM use a text-mode interface that displays
        single characters for every element of the dungeon. Vulture's replaces this
        with a fully graphical view of the dungeon, which makes learning the game easier.
        However the fully graphical view has the disadvantage that the level can no longer
        be displayed completely on the screen. To offset this disadvantage Vulture's
        has a map and a minimap.</p>


        <h2 id="map">2.1 The map</h2>

        <img style="margin:auto" src="img/map.png" alt="The map" />
        <p>The map shows you an abstract view of the entire level.<br />
        Monsters are represented by green circles containing a letter denoting the monster's class.<br />
        Objects are yellow and also contain a letter to indicate the type of object.<br />
        Traps are displayed in red. Since nethack traditionally uses the '^'
        symbol for all traps the trap glyphs on the map instead contain tiny images to make it possible
        to distinguish between them visually.<br />
        Other parts of the dungeon such as fountains, altars and sinks use small graphics</p>
        
        <p>You can move around and perform actions while the map open: clicking on an empty spot will
        cause you to move there; right-clicking anywhere will bring up the context-menu for that spot
        and so on.</p>


        <h2 id="minimap">2.2 The minimap</h2>

        <img style="float:left;" src="img/minimap.png" alt="The minimap" />
        <p>The minimap is another means for you to keep an eye on your surroundings.
        For example it allows you to know about monsters that are already in sight,
        but not yet within the area shown in the main view. The minimap uses colored
        dots to represent different items of interest:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You are shown in white</li>
            <li>Your pet is green</li>
            <li>Other inhabitants of the dungeon (even peaceful ones) are red</li>
            <li>Stairs are gray</li>
            <li>Doors are brown</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="first">Left-click on a spot on the minimap to move there.<br />
        Right-click anywhere on the minimap to center the main view on that spot.</p>

        <p class="first">You may disable the minimap in the interface options if you don't need it.</p>


        <h2 id="statuswin">2.3 The status window</h2>
        
        <p>The statuswindow contains several cryptic pieces of information
        describing your current status. Here are explanations of what the
        various status items mean:</p>
        
        <img style="margin:auto;" src="img/statusbar.png" alt="statusbar" />

        <table style="border-spacing:5px;">
            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Rank</td>
                <td>Your character's name and professional ranking (based on the
                experience level).</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Strength</td>
                <td>A  measure of your character's strength; one of your six
                basic attributes.  A human character's attributes can range
                from 3 to 18 inclusive; non-humans may exceed these limits
                (occasionally you may get super-strengths of the form 18/xx,
                and  magic  can  also  cause attributes to exceed the normal
                limits).  The higher your strength, the  stronger  you  are.
                Strength  affects  how  successfully  you  perform  physical
                tasks, how much damage you do in combat, and how  much  loot
                you can carry.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Dexterity</td>
                <td>Dexterity  affects  your  chances to hit in combat, to avoid
                traps, and do other tasks requiring agility or manipulation
                of objects.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Constitution</td>
                <td>Constitution  affects  your ability to recover from injuries
                and other strains on your stamina.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Intelligence</td>
                <td>Intelligence affects your ability to cast spells and read
                spellbooks.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Wisdom</td>
                <td>Wisdom comes from your practical experience (especially when
                dealing with magic). It affects your magical energy.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Charisma</td>
                <td>Charisma affects how certain creatures react toward you. In
                particular, it can affect the prices shopkeepers offer you.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Alignment</td>
                <td>Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic.  Often, Lawful is taken as good
                and Chaotic as evil, but legal and ethical do not always coincide.
                Your alignment influences how other monsters  react
                toward you.  Monsters of a like alignment are more likely to
                be non-aggressive, while those of an opposing alignment  are
                more likely to be seriously offended at your presence.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Dungeon Level</td>
                <td>How deep you are in the dungeon. You start at level one and
                the number increases as you go deeper into the dungeon.
                The Amulet of Yendor is reputed to be somewhere
                beneath the twentieth level.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Gold</td>
                <td>The number of gold pieces you are openly carrying. Gold
                which you have concealed in containers is not counted.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Hit Points</td>
                <td>Your current and maximum hit points. Hit points indicate
                how  much  damage you can take before you die. The more you
                get hit in a fight, the lower they get. You can regain hit
                points  by  resting, or by using certain magical items or
                spells. The number in parentheses is the maximum number
                your hit points can reach.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Power</td>
                <td>Spell points. This tells you how much mystic energy (mana)
                you have available for spell casting. Again, resting will
                regenerate the amount available.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Armor Class</td>
                <td>A measure of how effectively your armor stops blows from
                unfriendly creatures. The lower this number is, the more
                effective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative
                armor class.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Experience</td>
                <td>Your current experience level and experience points. As you
                adventure,  you  gain experience points.  At certain experience
                point totals, you gain an experience level. The more
                experienced you are, the better you fight and withstand magical
                attacks. Many dungeons show only your experience level
                here.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Time</td>
                <td>The number of turns elapsed so far, displayed if you have
                the time option set.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td class="cell1">Hunger status</td>
                <td>Your current hunger status, ranging from <b>Satiated</b> down to
                <b>Fainting</b>. If your hunger status is normal, it is not displayed.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>


        <p>Additional status flags may appear below the hunger status:
        <b>Conf</b> when you're confused, <b>FoodPois</b> or <b>Ill</b> when sick, <b>Blind</b> when
        you can't see, <b>Stun</b> when stunned, and <b>Hallu</b> when hallucinating.</p>
        
        <p>Some items in your staus display will be colored. The colors range from
        green (take note) to red (you are about to die!)</p>


        <h2 id="messagewin">2.4 The message window</h2>
        
        <img style="margin:auto" src="img/messages.png" alt="messages" />
        <p>The message window at the top of the screen is used for things that are
        impossible to represent visually. The message window displays 3 lines of
        messages by default. This works well even for small window sizes, however
        you may wish to increase this if you are playing Vulture's on a large screen.</p>
        
        <p>Messages in the message window start out white and slowly fade over time,
        until they vanish completely after 16 turns. If you wish to view older messages,
        you can open the message log which shows the last 256 messages.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="toolbars">2.5 The toolbars</h2>
        
        <img src="img/tb1.png" alt="messages" />
        <p>The upper of the two toolbars is called the action-toolbar. It's buttons
