        <h1>4. Commands</h1>
    </div>
    
    <div id="main">
        <p class="first"><img src="img/letter_c.png" alt="C" />ommands are given
        either with the mouse or by typing one or two characters.</p>

        <p>If you left-click an object, creature or location in the main view, Vulture's Eye
        will try to perform a <b>default action</b> for that object, creature or location.</p>
        
        <p class="first">The default actions are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>click a distant location to move closer to it</li>
            <li>click a closed door to open it</li>
            <li>click a hostile creature next to you to attack it</li>
            <li>at a fountain, click on yourself to take a drink</li>
            <li>on a stairwell, click on yourself to climb it</li>
            <li>on an object, click on yourself to pick it up</li>
            <li>at a chest, click on yourself to loot the chest</li>
            <li>otherwise, click on yourself to search your vicinity</li>
        </ul>

        <img style="float:left;margin:5px;" src="img/contextmenu.png" alt="Context menu" /> 

        <p>You can also right-click an object, creature or location. This brings up a 
        <b>context menu</b> which lists a number of likely commands. Click any of the 
        command buttons in the menu to perform that command, or click outside the menu 
        to dismiss it. For example, to kick a door, right-click it and
        select "kick" from the menu. (You might need to move closer first.)</p>

        <p>Some commands require more information, for example 
        a direction, or an object to be used. 
        If a command requires more information, NetHack will
        show you a menu of choices or a command line prompt requesting information. 
        Which one it is depends on the <b>menustyle</b> option.</p>

        <p>For example, a common question like &ldquo;What do
        you want to use? [a-zA-Z ?*]&rdquo;, asks you to choose an object you
        are carrying. Here, &ldquo;a-zA-Z&rdquo; are the inventory letters
        of your possible choices. Type &lsquo;?&rsquo; to see an inventory list of these items, 
        so you can see what the letters refer to. In this example, there is
        also a &lsquo;*&rsquo;, indicating that you may choose an object not on the list, if
        you wanted to use something unexpected. Typing a &lsquo;*&rsquo; lists
        your entire inventory.<br />
        Finally, if you don't want to do this command after all, 
        you can press the <span class="key">esc</span> key to cancel the command.</p>


        <p>You can put a number before some commands to repeat
        them; for example, &ldquo;n10s&rdquo; will search ten times.</p>

        <p>Commands for which counts make no sense ignore them. To cancel a count or a prefix, press the ESC
        key.</p>
        
        <p>Every command in Vulture's is accessible with the mouse.<br/>
        Commands involving objects in your inventory can be acessed by opening
        the inventory and right-clicking the object.<br />
        Most other commands can be invoked by right-clicking on yourself or some part of the dungeon.<br />
        Finally, a handful of rarely used commands are available only from the extended commands menu</p>
        
        <p>These commands (once again with the exception of a few extended commands) all have keyboard
        shortcuts. Using these is faster than using the mouse, so you will probably want to learn them
        eventually. The best way to go about that is to look up the key whenever you
        find you are performing an action frequently, rather than trying to memorize them all at once.</p>
        
        <p>The list of keyboard commands is rather long, but it can be read
        at any time during the game through the <b>help button</b>, 
        which displays a menu of helpful texts.<br/>
        Here are the commands for your reference:</p>
