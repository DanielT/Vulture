%
% This configuration file does not contain your personal settings. Editing

% settings are contained in the following locations:
%
% In unixes
%  $HOME/.vulture/vulture.conf
%  eg: /home/<user>/.vulture/vulture.conf
%
% In Mac OSX
%  It's exactly the same as for unix, however:
%  there is a setting in the system search window (Spotlight)... I quote from
%  the help file:
%  "Some files used by Mac OS X are not ordinarily visible. To search for
%   hidden files, choose Other from the far-left menu, and then select the
%   “File invisible” checkbox. In the related menu, choose Visible Items,
%   Invisible Items, or “Visible or Invisible.”"
% 
% In windows
%  $APPDATA$\Vulture\vulture.conf
%  eg: C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\Vulture\vulture.conf
% 
% Use this file only as a reference when editing your personal settings in your
% personal configuration file which can be found at the above locations.

% For system administrators: These settings are used as default settings when
% a user runs vulture's for the very first time at which time their own
% personal configuration file is created at the above locations.

% Wall Style
% ------------
% NetHack - Vulture's Eye features several different display styles for
% walls. The available styles are:

%                  can block your view of objects next to walls.
%    half_height   Short walls. Less realistic, but
%                  allows a better view.
%
wall_style=full
